Today, the 36-year-old actor has closed the curtain on his fantasy franchise days, and is instead getting his start in a new area of film with a similar cult following: Hallmark Channel romances!</p><p>On Saturday, November 25, Moseley will star alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Ramos</a> in Christmas in Notting Hill. See what this famous Brit has been up to over the past few years ahead of the film’s premiere!</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early days as an actor and Narnia</h2><p>Moseley’s very first role came at the age of 11 in the 1998 TV film Cider With Rosie, and it was the casting director he worked with on this film who recommended him for the Narnia role he would eventually become famous for. He originated the role of Peter Pevensie, the eldest Pevensie sibling, in the first film in the franchise, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in 2005. He continued to reprise this role in subsequent franchise films that included The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/GettyImages-55904431-edited.jpg><p>Fans of Narnia were ecstatic to learn of the Netflix adaptations of the film being developed by none other than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Greta Gerwig</a> — the mastermind behind Barbie (2023), Little Women (2019) and Lady Bird (2017). “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I haven’t even really started wrapping my arms around it, but I’m properly scared of it, which feels like a good place to start</a>,” she told the&nbsp;Total Film podcast.</p><p>As for Moseley’s take on this new Narnia era, he is hopeful for whatever they have in store. He told The Permanent Rain Podcast in 2021: “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix owns the rights to Narnia now, so they are in full control and whatever they want to do, they will do… I hope they make it, and I hope they do something powerful with it</a>. Really go for it, you know. It’s a beautiful world to have reign over, so I’m looking forward to seeing what they do.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>William Moseley’s life after Narnia</h2><p>After he retired the role of Peter Pevensie, William Moseley continued to act in various television shows and films over the years. Some of his most notable roles included that of Daniel Lombardi in the 2014 film Run, alongside Yellowstone’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelsey Asbille</a>, whom he was actually in a romantic relationship with between 2012 and 2018.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>‘Yellowstone’ Actress Kelly Reilly Admits: “I Don’t Want To Play Another Beth Dutton”</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/GettyImages-632355154-edited.jpg><p>Other roles included films such as The Silent Mountain, Magarita with a Straw, Friend Request, Carrie Pilby and The Veil. It wasn’t until 2015 where he was back, shining brighter in the limelight. Between 2015 and 2018, William Moseley played the role of Prince Liam in The Royals.</p><p>The series had him playing the part of a playboy royal whose hedonistic behavior gets put on pause when his older brother Robert, who bore the responsibility of being next in line for the throne, dies. With his death, Prince Liam is faced with a new set of challenges with the realization that he is next in the line of succession.</p><p>Moseley discussed his role with Collider in 2015: “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">For someone to go from being a royal rock star to having responsibilities, and having to change his entire life and rethink his personality, that is the bones of the show</a>. He has to rise to the occasion. What would happen if Prince Harry, when he was 19, suddenly had to be the next king? How would he feel? What would he have been like? It’s an interesting question to ask. We follow him. We see the world through his eyes…We see how hard that would actually be.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Working with Hollywood elite</h2><p>In 2022, Moseley starred alongside Mel Gibson in On the Line as Dylan. “<a href=#>I’ll be completely honest with you: I said yes to the script before I read it</a>. As soon as I heard Mel Gibson was the lead, I had a Skype with the director and he asked, ‘Would you like to do this?’ I said, Look, Mel’s the lead. I’m in.’ Then I read the script. It read like a magic trick,” he told Pop Culturalist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/GettyImages-1323348890-edited.jpg><p>He continued, discussing working alongside Gibson: “I’ve always felt that he finds humanity and a lot of commercial energy in his work, which I’ve always liked. Working with him was incredible.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>William Moseley takes on Hallmark</h2><p>On Saturday, November 25 at 6/5c on the Hallmark Channel <a href=#>‘Countdown to Christmas’ </a>, William Mosely will make his debut in Christmas in Notting Hill as Graham Savoy. Graham is a soccer star who has never made time for love. That is until he meets Georgia, a girl visiting from the United States who has no idea who the athlete is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/ChristmasInNottingHill_0590_RT_REV1.jpg-edited.jpg><p>As Mosely continues to grow as an actor, he maintains a positive outlook in terms of what’s in store for his future.</p><p>He told Pop Culturalist, “For me, what’s left on my bucket list is to continue to make good films, grow my spirit and energy, and continue to be proud of the work that I’m doing and the people I’m working with. I feel like I’m on the path now that I wanted to be on for a long time. I’m on it now, and I want to keep going forward.”</p><p>With that in mind, we can’t wait to see what he has in store for fans next! Could he be the next Hallmark hunk to grace the network?
