If you have found yourself spending on expensive shampoos or ones that claim that it contains no harsh chemicals, and still reaped no benefits, you’re in need of ph-balanced shampoos. It’s very important to use a shampoo with a low pH as your hair and scalp have a low acidic pH of around 4.5 to 5.5 if you want to avoid hair and scalp issues. If you use a shampoo with a high alkaline pH, it will emit negative electrical charges that cause friction between your tresses and leads to dryness, frizz, and hair breakage (<a href=#><strong>1</strong></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Stating the effects of pH imbalance, our contributor Eliza Pineda, In-house hair expert at Mayraki Professional, says, “When the pH balance of the scalp is off, there are a multitude of problems that can arise. This includes dandruff, extreme oiliness, hair loss, inflammation, irritation, and skin diseases like eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, and more.” So, choosing a pH-balanced shampoo that can maintain the right pH of your scalp is crucial.</p><p>Many salon or professional shampoos now come with a low pH, but it’s rare to find a shampoo that passes the litmus test to classify as a pH-balanced shampoo. Always remember to choose a neutral one rather than alkaline or acidic ones. After conducting experiments with them, we have selected the 11 best pH-balanced shampoos for soft, silky, and healthy hair.</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>What Does pH-balanced Mean?</h2></p><p>The pH level basically refers to how acidic or alkaline a product is. It is always tested on a scale of 1 to 14 and if it reads anywhere between 0 to 6.9 it is acidic and if it reads anywhere between 7.1 and 14 it indicates that it is alkaline. A pH of 7 is considered to be neutral. Speaking about your hair, its pH is around 3.7 and that of the scalp is 5.5. As our hair is acidic, it’s important that our shampoo is not alkaline and should be pH balanced between 4.5 and 5.5 for the perfect hair care routine (<a href=#><strong>2</strong></a>).</p><p><h2 class=title>How does pH Balance in Shampoos Improve Hair Health?</h2></p><p>A balanced pH level is extremely important for the health of your hair and scalp and stimulates hair growth. Our hair and scalp are acidic and if you use an alkaline shampoo that has a high pH it creates a negative electrical charge that causes friction between hair fibers causing brittle hair, hair damage and breakage.</p><p><h2 class=title>Benefits of Using pH-balanced Shampoos</h2></p><p>Most shampoos are alkaline but the pH level of our hair is acidic as it's approximately 3.7 and that of our scalp is around 5.5. If you do not use a pH balanced shampoo it will create friction in your hair because of a negative electrical charge causing hair damage and breakage. It will also cause frizziness because the cuticles will swell up and open.Your scalp may also be prone to fungal and bacterial infections. On the other hand, an acidic shampoo will cause the cuticles to shrink and lie flat making the hair softer and smoother. That’s why it’s important to avoid alkaline shampoos and go for one with a pH level between 4.5 and 5.5.</p><p><h2 class=title>11 Best pH-balanced Shampoos</h2></p><p>Get healthy, glossy tresses with Avalon Organics Therapy Thickening Shampoo with natural biotin B-Complex.

You can say goodbye to frizzy, damaged hair and welcome healthy and shiny hair. But when choosing the best pH-balanced shampoo there are other features you should consider in order to get the most out of it.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Choose the Best pH-balanced Shampoos?</h2></p><p>Your hair type and texture along with the key&nbsp; ingredients in the shampoo and what you should avoid, all need to be given due consideration.</p><p><strong>Moisturizing Ingredients</strong></p><p>The main issue with a shampoo that is not pH balanced is that it makes the hair dull and lifeless. To look soft and manageable, your hair should get all the hydration it needs, so look for pH-balanced shampoos that have moisturizing ingredients. Milk proteins and silk proteins as well as aloe vera and argan oil are all moisturizing. As are coconut milk, keratin, and jojoba oil. These ingredients not only hydrate your hair making it smooth and silky but also have a long-lasting effect.</p><p><strong>Ingredients to Avoid</strong></p><p>There are some ingredients commonly used in shampoos that can cause allergic reactions, irritation, and in some extreme cases even damage your scalp. Be careful to avoid these ingredients and try to go for a shampoo that is crafted with natural and skin-friendly ingredients. The things to avoid are harsh ingredients like parabens and phthalates as well as sulfates and alcohol. Synthetic fragrances are also a no-no. These ingredients strip your hair of its natural oils and cause dryness, itching, and irritation.</p><h3><strong>Hair Type</strong></h3><p>You need to choose a shampoo that is crafted for your specific hair type. Most shampoos come labeled with this information.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For oily hair, it’s best to avoid a shampoo with a high quantity of lipids or essential oils as it can make your hair heavy and greasy. Our contributor Eliza Penida shares, “The ideal pH level for a good shampoo is between 5.5 to 3.5. For oily hair, you can choose a clarifying shampoo with a pH of up to 5.5, to be used at most only once a week.”</li><li>For dry hair, you should choose a pH-balanced hydrating shampoo.</li><li>For thin and fine hair too, avoid a shampoo that has moisturizing ingredients or heavy oils as it makes your hair look limp and greasy.</li><li>If you have weak hair that breaks easily, a strengthening shampoo with a deep conditioner works wonders in rejuvenating your hair.</li><li>For hair treated with color go for a gentle shampoo that mentions that it is color-safe and devoid of chemicals.</li></ul><p>Our hair is our crowning glory and it deserves nothing less than the best pH-balanced shampoo to keep it healthy. Sometimes we don’t even realize the damage we are doing to our hair because of the harsh chemicals in it and we need to keep in mind that the perfect pH shampoo must have a gentle formula and be completely chemical-free. It’s important to verify the ingredients thoroughly and ensure that it is safe for your hair. It’s important to consider whether it’s worth the money as an expensive shampoo doesn’t always mean it’s the best. Do remember that the weather, water and food you are exposed to have a large role in deciding which shampoo best suits your hair. If these factors change, you may need to rethink your shampoo as it may no longer work as well.</p><p>According to <a href=#><u>Abbey Yung,</u></a> Trichologist in Training Hair, Skin & All Things Beauty, “ If you take a look at what happens to our hair when it's exposed to pH levels above 5.5, our hair porosity actually increases and that is not something that's desirable. Another thing that can happen is that there can actually be increased friction between hair fibres and that can actually cause increased breakage ….. Aside from those things there’s also just visual downsides to using products in these pH ranges. Our hair can just look really dry and dull and not have luster or shine and just really not look its healthiest or its best”. So if you take pride in your tresses and want to do the best for them, do go through our curated list of the 11 best ph-balanced shampoos and you just can’t go wrong.</p><p><strong>Contributor: Abbey Yung - </strong><a href=#><strong><u>Why You Need pH Balanced Shampoo</u></strong></a></p><p>Eliza Pineda, In-house hair expert at <a href=#>Mayraki Professional</a></p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>What pH shampoo is best?</p><p>The Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Thickening Shampoo is considered the best pH shampoo, especially for thinning hair. It is made from plant ingredients that strengthen and soften your hair from the root. Videri Peppermint & Tea Tree Shampoo is the best for oily hair and Joico Moisture Recovery Shampoo is great for dry hair.</p><p>What are the benefits of using a pH-balanced shampoo?</p><p>pH-balanced shampoos reduce dryness and frizz in the hair and thus prevent tangling and breakage while also keeping the hair cuticle sealed. pH-balanced shampoos are perfect for all types of hair as they don't strip the scalp or hair of its natural oil.</p><p>What pH level should I look for in a pH-balanced shampoo?</p><p>Whatever type of hair you might have, including colored hair, it’s always recommended to use a shampoo that’s pH balanced between 6 to 7 and should definitely not be higher than that.</p><p>How do pH-balanced shampoos differ from regular shampoos?</p><p>A pH-balanced shampoo means that it has the same acidic pH as your skin and hair which ranges between 4.5 to 5.5. Regular shampoos are more alkaline and have a pH above 7.</p><p>How can I restore the pH balance in my hair?</p><p>If your hair’s pH level has been disrupted, it’s good to try shampoos and oils that can fix it. It’s also best to see a specialist.</p><p>How do I test the pH of my hair?</p><p>The best and easiest way is to use litmus paper to determine the pH level of your hair or the products that you are going to apply to it. The litmus strips should have a range from 0 to 14. Just soak the litmus strip in your shampoo and observe how the color changes.</p><p>Are pH balanced shampoos suitable for all hair types?</p><p>pH balanced shampoos have a pH that ranges between 4.5 and 5.5.

Such shampoos are suitable for all hair types whether fine, straight, curly, or thick.</p><p>Can ph imbalance cause hair loss?</p><p>Yes, it can. Human hair and scalp have an acidic pH between 4.5 to 5.5, and when this is disrupted, it would lead to hair breakage and hair fall.</p><p>How often should I use a pH-balanced shampoo?</p><p>A pH-balanced shampoo can be used every day but if your hair is excessively dry it’s best to just use it a few times a week.</p><p>Can pH-balanced shampoos help in maintaining hair color or dyed hair?</p><p>It not only maintains hair color for a longer time, but it also helps to tackle issues like frizziness and tangling.</p><p>Why Use Low pH Shampoos?</p><p>A low pH formula shampoo helps to restore or maintain your hair’s pH at its natural level of 4.5 to 5.5. It prevents moisture loss, removes frizz by reducing static, and keeps the cuticles closed.</p><h2 class=title>Why Trust Pinkvilla</h2><p>With a keen eye for detail, our hair care expert, Alvira, carefully selects the best in haircare to help you find the most efficient products and tools for your tresses.
