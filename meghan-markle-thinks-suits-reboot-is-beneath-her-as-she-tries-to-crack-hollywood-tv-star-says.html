The 42-year-old stepped away from her <a href=#>Hollywood</a> career after she met and married into The Firm in 2018. She left behind her acting days to marry <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> before they decided to step down as senior royals and move across the pond to California in the US, where they share children Archie and Lilibet. However, rumors have been flying around about a reboot of the <a href=#>TV</a> show Suits, but there are doubts she will reunite with her cast mates.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-506192854-842x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-suits-reboot-is-beneath-meghan-markle>Suits reboot is ‘beneath’ Meghan Markle</h2><p>Speaking on Sky News Australia, the host of the To Di For podcast Kinsey Schofield <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">says</a> she thinks Meghan Markle won’t come back for the reboot of Suits as it’s “beneath her.”</p><p>Schofield said: “It is being reported that in this new Suits spin-off there’s a character that’s cut for her specifically to a T.</p><p>“However, I would argue that we did not see Meghan reunite with the cast of Suits as the <a href=#>Golden Globes</a> a few weeks ago.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Meghan Markle returning to Hollywood with ‘Suits reunion isn’t going to happen’</a></p><p>“[It] would have been a strong, independent statement reminding the world that she was somebody before she married Harry, and she opted not to do that. I believe, socially, she thinks she’s risen to a much higher level than fourth on the Suits call sheet.”</p><p>Meghan starred in the law drama, which aired on the USA Network, for nine seasons between 2011 and 2018 (though her last scenes were filmed a year prior). She then left the glamorous film star life to become a <a href=#>royal</a>. She played paralegal Rachel Zane who ended up moving to Seattle at the end of season seven with her husband Mike Ross (Patrick J Adams).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-may-return-for-the-reboot-in-another-way>Meghan may ‘return for the reboot in another way’</h2><p>Although, a source claims it is on the cards. An insider revealed the bosses behind the Suits reboot are <a href=#>doing ‘everything they can’ to get Meghan Markle involved</a>. Even if it means a very high price tag.</p><p>The source told the Daily Express: “Meghan is in a commanding position. They want to expand a successful franchise in which she has a&nbsp;ready-made fan base of millions worldwide. They want her back, and they are prepared to pay what it takes to get her.”</p><p>The celebrity could even try her hand at directing, as there is talk of her doing so for at least one episode of the new series. This would confirm <a href=#>what she has said previously</a> about returning to her old job.</p><p>The reboot would be titled&nbsp;Suits: Los Angeles and would see the former actress return as a new character who resembles Meghan. A description for her reads: “[in her] 30s, Black, SoCal native and Harvard Law alum. She’s jockeying to be made Head of Entertainment. She’s great at closing clients but struggles elsewhere. Smarter than everyone.”</p><p>The series has been green-lit, and an official announcement from NBCUniversal about the reboot is expected soon. Beatrice Springborn, who is a boss at Universal International Studios, said at an industry conference before Christmas the show is being worked on “right now.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Harry and Meghan pose with ‘TV bosses’ weeks after rumors of Duchess’ ‘Hollywood comeback’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2V%2BcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55kraCZo7i0edKuoK2rXaeyo7vOrWSiq12Xsq%2BxwK2fZqCVp3qiv4ysn55lpKe2pr%2BMraZmm6KWsKx5x6ijpbGnpLyledOvZKyskad6tK3YrGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-paper-cut.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What does it mean to dream about Paper cut</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hannah-stocking.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hannah Stocking</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
