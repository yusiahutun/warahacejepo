Hailing from South Florida, she traveled to Los Angeles, intending to "make it." She was only sixteen at the time.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Having landed a few notable dancing/singing gigs, DaniLeigh eventually skyrocketed to national superstardom with her gold-certified&nbsp;single Lil Bebe. Continuing on her career trajectory, she then released her debut album entitled The Plan.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Released in November 2018, The Plan was DaniLeigh's coming-of-age tale. In the LP, she paid fitting homage to her heritage&nbsp;and family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Bio -&nbsp;Ethnicity &&nbsp;Parents</h2><p style=text-align:justify>With the real name&nbsp;Danielle Leigh Curiel,&nbsp;DaniLeigh was born in 1994&nbsp;to parents Vladimir (father) and Vicky Curiel (mother).

By the time she was 12, she had already started dancing, and at the age of 12, she had started singing. However, initially, she was shy to show her singing talent until she got positive feedbacks.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>And having loving parents by her side, the&nbsp;Easy&nbsp;hitmaker's family supported her artistic aspirations. To help her realize her show-biz&nbsp;dreams, her parents left their booming restaurant business in Orlando and moved to LA.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Although she had already posted cover songs of Musiq Soulchild's 'So Beautiful' on YouTube, her career didn't officially start until she moved to LA.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>She then started as a background dancer for artists, including Pharrell Williams and Nelly Furtado. She had even formed a pop dancing duo with her sister Curly Fryz.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Talent seems to run&nbsp;in the 26&nbsp;years old songstress' family.

Meanwhile, it was through her father's lineage that she drew inclination towards singing.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Creating a buzz through YouTube covers, DaniLeigh - who stands five feet & five inches (1.65 m)&nbsp;in height -&nbsp;got discovered by Prince. The two collaborated on the late singer's "Breakfast Can Wait" music video; At that time, she was 18.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>In 2015, she released her first single, 'D.O.S.E,' but it was not as successful as her second single, 'Play.' The song is an empowerment for women and Latinos; The single also&nbsp;features Mexican-American rapper Kap&nbsp;G. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p style=text-align:justify>In 2017 - a year after Prince's passing - the Be Yourself songstress dropped her first project titled Summer With Friends.

Well, it is for sure that&nbsp;DaniLeigh has a net worth of millions, but the actual value remains confined.&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Boyfriend & Dating Related</h2><p style=text-align:justify>With no dating history to show off, DaniLeigh opened&nbsp;herself up to rumors.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Her chemistry with Chris Brown in the music video for Easy was palpable. Fans were quick to label the No Guidance singer as&nbsp;her "boyfriend." To their dismay, the fictitious romance never took off outside the working relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>DaniLeigh with Chris Brown dancing in 2019 single&nbsp;Easy's&nbsp;music video</strong> (Photo:- Hollywoodlife.com)</p><p style=text-align:justify>Nevertheless, while talking to 247HH in 2017, DaniLeigh outlined her boyfriend's&nbsp;requirements. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Equally Elusive Dating Life:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Aisha Dee Height, Parents, Gay, Net Worth" rel=follow>Aisha Dee Height, Ethnicity,&nbsp;Parents, Gay, Net Worth</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Admittedly, she wanted her man to ooze confidence and have a modest fashion sense.
