She’s been doing so for over 15 years! Now, the designer is hosting HGTV’s new show </span><i><span>Revealed</span></i><span>, where she incorporates her clients’ family history and heritage into her home designs for them.</span></p><p><span>Let’s get to know this brand new host better as this Veronica Valencia Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Veronica Valencia On HGTV Revealed</b></h3><p><span>Veronica Valencia has been in the design industry for over 2 decades, and if there’s anything she learned from it, it’s the longevity of a house. Even when the owners are no longer there, the house stays forever to tell their story.</span></p><p><span>With this in mind, the designer had the idea to dig deep to uncover each family’s unique history and infuse the spaces in their home with the techniques, materials, and heirlooms that reflected the family’s culture. Thus, HGTV’s </span><i><span>Revealed</span></i><span> was born.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Designs become living histories when designer Veronica Valencia dives into her clients’ family heritage for renovation inspiration,” the show’s official synopsis read.</span></p><p><span>A Mexican and Native American designer, Veronica confessed that culture and tradition have always played a vital role in her life. Over the years, she’s been inspired to tell a family’s story through design in over 600 home renovations. “I believe that discovering our roots can profoundly influence every aspect of our lives,” she said.</span></p><p><span>But the designer was never alone on her journey to engrave her clients’ family heritage into their homes. Her </span><i><span>Extreme Makeover</span></i><span> crew David Bohler, Tommy Rouse, and Joshua Smith were always there with her, and are still with her on the brand-new HGTV show.</span></p><p><span>“We are such a collaborative group. I value their friendship as much as their knowledge and expertise. They just make all of the projects I work on so much better, and they mean everything to me. I honestly would be nothing without them,” Veronica said.</span></p><p><span>Also, since the show was getting positive responses, Veronica shared that she was&nbsp; “truly overwhelmed” as she spent years on the project.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Veronica Valencia Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Veronica Valencia flaunted a net worth of above $1 million in 2023.</span></p><p><span>This talented designer started her career in 2003, right after she finished design school, as an assistant to a California-based interior designer, Paige Hemmi. One day, she then received a call from someone from </span><i><span>Extreme Makeover</span></i><span>, asking her to work on their design team, and the rest is history.</span></p><p><span>Fast-forward to 2023, Veronica has been working behind the scenes for over 15 years for some of the most well-known makeover shows on television. Also, she’s now the founder of </span><i><span>The Design Hunters</span></i><span>, a company that collaborated with commercial brands, television networks, photographers, builders, architects, nonprofit organizations, and other designers to produce design content.</span></p><p><span>To list her works, Veronica has offered her services to networks such as ABC, OWN, FOX, NBC, and NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, and her team has collectively produced and styled well over 500 home renovations, photo shoots, and events across the country.</span></p><p><span>Her works have also been featured in My Domaine, Remodelista, The New York Times, Style Me Pretty, Green Wedding Shoes, Lucky Magazine, and more.</span></p><p><span>“I pretty much design and style anything I can get my hands on. I design homes and creative direct both interiors and exteriors for lots and lots of design makeover shows, style weddings, commercial spaces, photo shoots, floral arrangements, and even a good ol’ party once in a while,” she described herself.</span></p><h3><b>Veronica Valencia Height</b></h3><p><span>Veronica Valencia stands tall at a height of above 5 feet 3 inches (160 cm).</span></p><h3><b>Is Veronica Valencia Married?</b></h3><p><span>Veronica Valencia married her husband Kris Hughes on November 11, 2016, at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu, California.</span></p><p><span>“November 11 was easily the most magical day of my life,” she shared. “I married my best friend, my business partner, and my life partner. I have no words for the ceremony. The moment I hit the aisle; my heart literally skipped a beat.”</span></p><p><span>The designer first met Kris in 2012 in New York City on a television show. “He was the show’s production manager,” she recalled. “When the show ended, I said, ‘Come to Los Angeles, and I promise we can get on a show together!’”</span></p><p><span>Now, the two indeed are working together. In fact, Veronica started </span><i><span>The Design Hunters</span></i><span> with her husband. She shared that the best part about working together with Kris is that, combined, they have so much professional experience. On the contrary, the hard part was managing their professional lives and being parents. “I don’t remember the last time we went on a date night,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Talking about their kids, Veronica and Kris welcomed Hunter Babe Hughes on October 27, 2018, and River in 2021.</span></p><p><span>As for her husband, Kris Hughes is a Bronx, New York native who worked as a Business and Project Manager at </span><i><span>The Design Hunters</span></i><span>. Find him on IG @</span><a href=#><span>mr.kristopher</span></a><span> and FB @</span><a href=#><span>kris.hughes.18</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>On Kris’s birthday (i.e. on Jan 7) 2023,&nbsp; Veronica took to her IG to write, “Thank you for being so easy to love. The best decision I ever made. Cheers to the life we have built together… cheers to our two beautiful children”</span></p><h3><b>Veronica Valencia Age</b></h3><p><span>When <i>Revealed</i> premiered in 2023 on HGTV, Veronica Valencia was 37 years of age</span><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Veronica Valencia Family</b></h3><p><span>Veronica Valencia comes from a family of six.</span></p><p><span>Her father, Armando Valencia was a captain in the Los Angeles fire department. He often took Veronica around to model homes on the weekends because she was fascinated by their staging and architecture. “We would pretend we were interested in buying a house just so I could get in and have a look,” the HGTV host recalled.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, we don’t know much about Veronica’s mother Anita Valencia except that she loved her to the moon. “You are beyond selfless. You’re compassionate and never hold grudges. You’re patient. You have more energy than anyone I know. You’re sweet, kind-hearted, and beautiful. You aren’t just my mom, you’re my other sister and my best friend,” Veronica dedicated an FB post to her.</span></p><p><span>Her parents, Armando and Anita both turned 60 in 2023.</span></p><p><span>As for her siblings, they are, Elizabeth M Valencia (born: Aug 1987), Katherine Valencia (born: Mar 1993), and David Valencia (born: Jun 1989).</span></p><p><span>Her sister, Katherin also studied at the </span><i><span>Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising</span></i><span>, and now works as a Photographer. While her brother, David went on to co-found Overly Social (a Marketing Agency in Los Angeles for Local Businesses) and MintWorld (an NFT Artwork & Virtual trading company).</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Veronica Valencia Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Veronica receives her birthday wishes on September 11.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Veronica Valencia From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Veronica hails from Los Angeles, California.
