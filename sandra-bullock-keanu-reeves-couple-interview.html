Now, Bullock is finally putting those dating rumors to bed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Speaking with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a38241136/keanu-reeves-interview-2021/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Esquire class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Esquire</a> for a cover story on the John Wick actor, Bullock confirmed that the two had really never dated. Still, she added, "But who knows?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Keanu's a guy who, I feel like, is friends with every woman he's ever dated. I don't think there's anyone who has something horrible to say about him," Bullock said. "So maybe we could have survived. I don't know. But we didn't have to survive anything. We just get to grow up together on parallel roads and tip our hats and meet for a dinner and try to work together. And the longer time goes on, the more in awe I am of the human being. Would I have been able to say that if he had dumped me and made me angry? Probably not."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actress recalled an anecdote that took place about a year after Speed was released. She'd mentioned to Reeves that she had never tried champagne and truffles, a statement he acknowledged casually at the time. A few days later, while Bullock was at her home with a girlfriend, Reeves turned up on his motorcycle—champagne, truffles, and flowers in hand. He told her, according to Esquire, "I just thought you might want to try Champagne and truffles, to see what it's like." He joined Bullock and her girlfriend, even letting the actress paint his nails black. Soon after, he left to go on a date.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"That's what I mean that it drives you crazy," Bullock told the magazine. "When I first met him, I would spend as much time as I could filling a silence, just to feel comfortable. And the more I jibber-jabbered on, the quieter he would get. And I thought, I don't understand what's happening! He's looking at me with eyes of confusion. He's quiet. Did I say something to offend him? And then a day or two later, he would arrive with a note or a little package, saying, 'I thought about what you said.' And he would have his response."</p><img alt="sandra bullock and keanu reeves during the lake house london premiere outside arrivals at vue west end in london, great britain photo by ferdaus shamimwireimage" title="&amp;quot;The Lake House&amp;quot; London Premiere - Outside Arrivals" width=1845 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-112352008-1637677877.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Ferdaus Shamim</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves during The Lake House London premiere.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bullock and Reeves previously confessed to having crushes on each other during separate appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Looking back at old stills from Speed, Bullock swooned over Reeves. "I think about how sweet Keanu Reeves was and how handsome he was," she told DeGeneres in 2018. "It was hard for me to really be serious. He would look at me and I'd be like [giggles]."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also reassured DeGeneres that the two never dated. "There's just something about me that I guess he didn't like," she joked.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Reeves reciprocated the sentiment in an interview on the talk show the following year.
