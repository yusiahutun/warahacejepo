In an interview <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a> in 2021, Swift called Red her only “true” heartbreak album, and it’s believed that “heartbreak” was caused by Jake Gyllenhaal, whom she dated from October 2010 to January 2011.&nbsp;“I look back on this [Red] as my true breakup album, every other album has flickers of different things. But this was an album that I wrote specifically about pure, absolute, to the core, heartbreak,” Swift said at the time.</p><p>In “The Very First Night,” Swift sings about how used to “dance in the kitchen” and how her boyfriend at the time would “chase me down the hallway,” which seemed to be a reference from her other Red song, “All Too Well” believed to be about Gyllenhaal), where Swift sings: “We’re dancing ’round the kitchen in the refrigerator light / Down the stairs, I was there.”</p><p>In another lyric, Swift referenced a hotel. “‘<span class=s2>Cause they don’t know about the night in the hotel,” she sings. Some fans believe the lyric is a reference to when Gyllenhaal flew Swift to London, where they stayed at the Dorchester Hotel, in 2010.</span></p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">New York magazine</a> in 2013, Swift revealed how the subject of Red, who is believed to be Gyllenhaal, reacted to the album. (She claimed that the reaction was better than the “crazy emails” she received from another ex-boyfriend, who is believed to be John Mayer.) “He was like, ‘I just listened to the album, and that was a really bittersweet experience for me. It was like going through a photo album.’ That was nice,” Swift said at the time. “Nicer than, like, the ranting, crazy e-mails I got from this one dude.”</p><p>While many lyrics in “The Very First Night’ point to Gyllenhaal, some fans believe that the song could be about Swift’s other ex-boyfriend, Harry Styles, whom she dated from late 2012 to early 2013. The main clue is the lyric, “<span class=s1>We were built to fall apart,” which is the same lyric seen in Swift’s 1989 song, “Out of the Woods,” which is believed to be about Styles. Another piece of evidence is the sound of “The Very First Night,” which fans believe is a precursor to the sound of 1989, Swift’s next album after Red.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“It is so Haylor. Sounds way more kiddish and young love to me. Very 1989 reminiscent. Jake songs give me much more mature, serious vibes to me. I picture Harry and Taylor all giddy like this when they first met,” one user wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit.</a></p><p>Read the lyrics to Taylor Swift’s “The Very First Night”, via
