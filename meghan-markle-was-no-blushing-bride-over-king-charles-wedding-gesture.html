She exchanged vows with her ‘Haz’ – the cute nickname she likes to give the Duke of Sussex. <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> married the Duchess in a fairytale ceremony in St George’s Chapel five years ago. However, only days before their big day, her dad Thomas Markle dropped out of appearing, over health fears, and subsequently left the Duchess in the lurch. But <a href=#>King Charles</a> swooped in to extend a moving gesture to his future daughter-in-law. Although, it reportedly saw a bold reply from the Suits actor.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-was-no-blushing-bride-to-king-charles-gesture>Meghan Markle was no ‘blushing bride’ to King Charles’ gesture</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1052323750-1024x683.jpg><p>To prevent any fears of the big day being ruined or affected by Thomas Markle not being able to make the trip, Charles stepped in. It came after <a href=# rel=nofollow>reports</a> from The Mirror of several hiccups leading to the <a href=#>royals</a>‘ wedding day. From a row with <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>, the Princess of Wales – which Meghan later told Oprah the rumors were the other way round – to reports of tiaras causing trouble.</p><p>The former Prince of Wales offered to do one of the most important roles of the wedding itself.</p><p>According to Robert Hardman, author of Queen of Our Times, he was honored to offer to escort Meghan down the aisle for the ceremony. But, it’s claimed Meghan didn’t jump for joy at the gesture, and made a different suggestion.</p><p>Hardman wrote: “The reply, according to one friend, was not quite what he was expecting: “Can we meet halfway?'” Here was an indicator that this was no blushing bride, but a confident, independent woman determined to make a grand entrance on her own.”</p><p>On the day itself, after the royal family arrived in the chapel and took their seats, Meghan appeared around noon. She began walking down the aisle and met King Charles. He escorted her the remainder of the way, through the quire of the chapel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inside Harry and Meghan’s wedding</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-960096296-1024x683.jpg><p>The wedding, which was watched by a whopping 1.9 billion fans.</p><p>The royal family, who paid for the special day, are estimated to have splashed out $32 million. The real figure has never been released. However, experts estimate it cost $50,000 for the cake, $110,000 for flowers and food more than $280,000, for the televised event.</p><p>It’s believed the security for the event was below $3 million. Although the expensive day may seem a hefty sum, it’s said tourists flocking to see the couple in their best outfits brought in $80 million.</p><p>Meghan, looking like a princess out of a Disney movie, wore a custom-made Givenchy gown. It had long sleeves and a sweeping train. The classy fashion number also featured a 16-ft silk veil. It was embroidered with 55 flowers to represent the Commonwealth, as well as California and where she lived with Harry.</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II loaned a diamond tiara to Meghan, which was made back in 1932 for Queen Mary.</p><p>Fans began appearing outside Windsor Castle from 8am on the day. They wanted to get ahead before <a href=#>celebrity</a> guests began arriving 90 minutes later.</p><p>After the ceremony, the newly-wed couple walked out of the chapel and kissed on the steps to adoring fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Expanding the family</h2><p>After the two got hitched, they welcomed two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. The toddlers received their Prince and Princess titles when King Charles ascended to the throne – as per royal protocol.</p><p>However, the relations with Buckingham Palace appeared to take a turn. It came after they stepped down as senior members of the royal family the following year. Harry and Meghan temporarily moved to Canada before finding their home in Montecito, California.</p><p>The couple sat down with Oprah for a bombshell tell-all interview where they claimed they received ill-treatment from The Firm and social media. The palace later responded to the allegations in the interview, detailing they would deal with it privately.</p><p>Following on from this, Harry opened up over his mental <a href=#>health</a> with Oprah again in an Apple TV documentary, The Me You Can’t See. He also joined up with fellow Brit James Corden for a segment on his chat show. Then Meghan tried to get gags of laughs in a silly <a href=#>TV</a> prank section on Ellen.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2aCcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55ksJmjYruwecGlrKygmaO0bq7RopueZZ%2BrsrN5yqKloGWTna6zuMSsZLCdlJm2r7OMoJysrKWnsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nevada-institutes-9-tax-for-large-live-events.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nevada Institutes 9% Tax For Large Live Events</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./la-times-drama-honor-crossword-clue-answer-1176428.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>LA Times Drama honor Crossword Clue Answer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
