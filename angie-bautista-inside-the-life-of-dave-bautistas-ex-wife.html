The latter is the case for Angie Bautista, who gained notoriety because of her marriage to David “Dave” Bautista. Angie’s ex-husband, Dave, is an American actor and retired professional wrestler who wrestled in WWE between 2002 and 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>In his acting career, he is famous for his portrayal of Drax the Destroyer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe “Guardians of the Galaxy” (2014) up until “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” (2023), after which he confirmed leaving the franchise.</p><p>Although Angie’s marriage to Dave Bautista lasted only about eight years, the former WWE wrestler appears to have a soft spot for her. Aside from having red kanji lettering on his upper left biceps, which says “Angel” (in tribute to Angie), Dave’s role in raising funds for her when she battled cancer will keep lingering in her mind.</p><p>Here’s a look into the life of David Bautista’s ex-wife, her marriage, career, and personal life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-13_03-43-27-fotor-2023101342413.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Angie_Bautista></span>Who Is Angie Bautista?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Angie Bautista was born Angie Lewis in the USA. Beyond this, little to no information is available on her family and early life. Despite once being married to one of the biggest World Wrestling Entertainment stars of all time, Angie has never actively sought out the spotlight. The former celebrity spouse keeps a low profile and only rose to fame after marrying Dave Bautista.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, the identity of her parents and siblings elude the media. In addition, details about her educational background and achievements remain a mystery. However, reports suggest she is a fitness enthusiast like her ex-husband.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Angie_Bautista_Do></span>What Does Angie Bautista Do?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Like most details about her life, Angie Bautista’s career choice is a mystery. Although reports suggest she worked in fitness, there is no evidence to back the claims up. On the other hand, her ex-husband initially became famous for his career with WWE, where he wrestled under the ring name Batista.&nbsp;</p><p>With WWE, Dave Bautista became a four-time WWE World Heavyweight Champion and two-time WWE Champion. In addition, he is a three-time World Tag Team Champion and a one-time WWE Tag Team Champion. Angie’s ex-husband is also the 2005 and 2014 Royal Rumble winner, and he headlined WrestleMania 21 and WrestleMania XXX.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the former WWE champion debuted as an actor in an uncredited role in the 2006 comedy “Relative Strangers.” Afterward, Dave has since appeared as Drax the Destroyer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film, “Guardians of the Galaxy.” He also appeared as Mr. Hinx in the James Bond film “Spectre,” and as Sapper Morton in “Blade Runner 2049.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-13_03-43-20-fotor-2023101341921.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Dave_Bautista_and_Angie_Bautista_Meet></span>When Did Dave Bautista and Angie Bautista Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Due to the former couple’s cagey lifestyle, there are no details regarding when they started dating. However, Angie Bautista and Dave tied the knot on November 16, 1998. The then-couple were together for about eight years before divorcing in 2006. During their marriage, Dave became an avid collector of vintage metal lunchboxes.</p><p>The renowned actor’s collection reportedly started when he bought his ex-wife, Angie, an E.T. lunchbox, and she did not want to break it, so he bought a second one. However, his favorite is the 1967 Green Hornet lunchbox with a picture of Bruce Lee on it.&nbsp;</p><p>Before his marriage to Angie, Dave had been married once. His first wife was Glenda Fe Bautista, whom he married on March 25, 1990. They have two daughters, Keilani (1990) and Athena (1992). However, Dave and Glenda finalized their divorce on April 1, 1998.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Children_Does_Dave_Bautistas_Ex-Wife_Have></span>How Many Children Does Dave Bautista’s Ex-Wife Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Angie Bautista has a child with the former WWE star. During their marriage, the former couple welcomed a son, Oliver Bautista, in 2007. Angie’s son, Oliver Bautista, was born through in-vitro fertilization (IVF) while she was in remission. Hence, she calls Oliver her “Miracle Baby.” Before the birth of her son, Angie was diagnosed with ovarian cancer on September 9, 2002.&nbsp;</p><p>Angie went in and out of remission in the ensuing years multiple times. About her experience battling cancer, Angie stated that cancer doesn’t look like one thing. She elaborated, “People think that people with cancer look a certain way, but cancer can affect someone who appears perfectly physically fit.”</p><p>After her treatments started, Dave traveled across the United States to make a video to raise money for ovarian cancer research. Released in August 2010, the renowned actor dedicated the video, Bautista vs Cancer, to Angie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-13_03-43-35-fotor-2023101342020.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Is_Dave_Bautistas_Second_Wife_Now></span>Where Is Dave Bautista’s Second Wife Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Like Ron Perlman’s ex-wife, <a href=#>Opal Stone Perlman</a>, Angie Bautista likes to live off social media and public radar. However, reports suggest she is happy doing things she finds interesting. In addition, she spends quality time with her miracle baby, Oliver.</p><p>On the other hand, <a href=#>Dave Bautista</a> married competitive pole dancer Sarah Jade in October 2015. However, they separated in early 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51krq%2BzyJ5km5mlqba0wMBmoKermZmybsDHnmSloZaaerCyjJ2Yr51dl662wMisq5qrXZrFbsPIn5xo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fox-news-contributor-tomi-lahren-slams-woman-heckled-threw-drinks-brunch-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren slams woman who threw drinks at her</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebs-who-kept-their-pregnancies-under-wraps.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>13 Celebs Who Kept Their Pregnancies Under Wraps</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
