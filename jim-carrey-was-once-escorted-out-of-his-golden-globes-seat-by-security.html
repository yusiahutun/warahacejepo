The two A-listers told the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> icon they had a problem with where he was sitting. Luckily, he didn’t make a scene when ‘security’ came in.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jim-carrey-was-escorted-by-security-during-the-golden-globes>Jim Carrey was escorted by security during the Golden Globes</h2><p>During their opening monologue, Sandra and Andy joked about various famous faces in attendance for that year’s <a href=#>Golden Globes</a> before turning their attention to Jim Carrey … who they had escorted to another area of the dining room. They claimed it was “awkward”, but it had to be done!</p><p>Beginning the bit, Sandra, 52, turned to Andy, 45, and said: “I am seeing Jim Carrey sitting up front tonight in the <a href=#>movie</a> section even though he’s nominated for a <a href=#>TV</a> show.”</p><p>Andy replied: “That’s not going to work, I am so sorry, Jim but we are going to have to ask you to vacate the movie section and go sit with the TV folk.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Police joke they’re ‘investigating’ Margot Robbie being ‘robbed’ of an Oscar</a></p><p>Jim looked offended and replied: “You’re kidding, right?”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a>, 62, was nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy for the series Kidding. The show itself was up for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy.</p><p>Jim tried to salvage the moment by stating he was starring in the then-upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog film, but the presenters were unmoved.</p><p>Andy continued him: “Well, come back next year. I’m sure it’ll be nominated,” as a bodyguard appeared at Jim’s side.</p><p>He grabbed his plate and yelled: “I’m going, should I take my dinner too? I wouldn’t want to leave any of my DNA in the film section” which got a laugh from the crowd.</p><p>As Sandra and Andy further tried to apologize to Jim, he quipped: “I’m sorry, I can’t hear you. I see your lips moving, but there’s a delay, it takes a long time for the sound to get this far.” He then put two drinking glasses to his eyes, pretending they were binoculars, helping him see the pair from a distance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jim-carrey-once-ripped-into-the-awards-ceremony>Jim Carrey once ripped into the awards ceremony</h2><p>Not one afraid to speak his mind, he once ripped into the accolade. When he hosted a category for the <a href=#>award show</a> 2016, his open monologue even made Denzel Washington laugh. The star currently has two Golden Globe Awards, though he has been nominated five times.</p><p>In his speech, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> he wanted to win for a third time.</p><p>He says: “I am two-time Golden Globe winner Jim Carrey. You know, when I’m going to sleep at night, I’m not just a guy going to sleep. I’m two-time Golden Globe winner Jim Carrey going to get some well needed shut-eye.</p><p>“And when I dream, I don’t just dream any old dreams. No sir. I dream about being three-time Golden Globe winner Jim Carrey. Because then I would be enough. It would finally be true. And I could stop this, this terrible search. For what I know ultimately won’t fulfill me.”</p><p>He continued: “But these are important, these awards. I don’t want you to think just because you blew up our solar system alone, you wouldn’t be able to find us or any of human history with the naked eye, but from our perspective, this is huge.</p><p>“One more time, here are the nominees for best motion picture, comedy.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Tom Holland’s seven-figure check ended up in another actor’s bank account</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2h9cLbIpmScmaKnsrp51pqqZqeemLJusdKcpquslZl6sMHTZqafZZiewG6zzqWbnqZdnLmwrsSsZKydkal6o8WMrJycraKewbp7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bejeweled-music-video-easter-eggs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift Bejeweled Music Video Easter Eggs: Speak Now' Clues</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-get-bigger-butt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Get a Bigger Butt: Trainer Tips</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
