Cooper has been lost for a quarter-century in a sort of purgatory, trapped in a horrifying parallel plane in which Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) takes her face off and one of Lynch’s most terrifying creations, “the arm,” speaks to him. When he finally does return to the “real world,” he can barely communicate, and it seems as though he’s replaced the wrong doppelgänger, taking the life of a Nevada family man named Dougie Jones. Meanwhile, the evil Dale Cooper is a violent criminal who avoids being taken back to the Black Lodge but can’t avoid looking like Tommy Wiseau.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj30lgie1007kqgy6wav6qujo@published data-word-count=5><strong>David Lynch as Gordon Cole</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/302/ca9/e274e2e2f0d21378c328f7aa2dd1fa8cd2-twin-peaks-01.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj30lgim8007nqgy6m8spre47@published data-word-count=65>Yes, that’s the singular filmmaker himself, back as the hard-of-hearing FBI head who gets sucked back into the world of Cooper most completely in episode four. It’s also a bittersweet pleasure to see Gordon interacting with Miguel Ferrer’s Albert again, as the wonderful character actor passed away earlier this year.

Gordon now answers to Denise, the chief of staff of the entire Federal Bureau of Investigation (say it all at once, unabbreviated). She admonishes Gordon for taking a young, beautiful agent on assignment with him, to which Gordon reminds Denise that he’s supported her for years. It’s unclear if we’ll see Denise again, but it’s fun to know she’s in charge, and that these two are still “good buddies.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj30lgigx007qm0ye70o58lt6@published data-word-count=17><strong>Kimmy Robertson as Lucy Brennan, Harry Goaz as Andy Brennan, and Michael Horse as Tommy “Hawk” Hill<br></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ab6/d24/45c88a369063571dc97b978ff02759f879-twin-peaks-06.rhorizontal.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj30lgihp007rm0ye0qf1cfvv@published data-word-count=99>There’s almost no turnover at the Twin Peaks Police Department, and little technological development in the last quarter-century. While the first four episodes of Twin Peaks are mostly terrifying, there’s something comforting in seeing that Lucy and Andy are still a couple, and as wonderfully, anachronistically naïve as ever. The revelation that Lucy essentially considers smartphones to be supernatural impossibilities is particularly amazing when one realizes how much truly otherworldly stuff is going on in these first four hours. And the casting of Lucy and Andy’s son is too perfect to spoil, even in a piece like this one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/890/343/6ae0c332f6db1ab56754e5f987cbdd7eb6-22-lucy-andy.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj30lgiky007mqgy6u6fus4gz@published data-word-count=5><strong>Dana Ashbrook as Bobby Briggs</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/698/3f1/f6e89ca81d2c570fdf7ef09450b9a698c6-twin-peaks-09.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj30lgiz4007oqgy6tsns1s9w@published data-word-count=117>We may have spotted <strong>M</strong><b>ä</b><strong>dchen Amick’s Shelley</strong> and <strong>James Marshall’s James</strong> in the Bang Bang Bar at the end of the first two hours, but Bobby gets the most notable screen time of the “young players” from the original iteration in episode four. It makes perfect sense that Bobby would follow his father into some form of authority-figure role and become a cop. Will he be a partner or adversary for Cooper, presuming Dale makes it back to Twin Peaks? Only time will tell, but his response upon seeing Laura Palmer’s photo — and the brilliant use of Angelo Badalamenti’s theme in that moment — provided one of the truly unforgettable emotional beats of this initial quartet.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj30lgiq4007tm0yefsg2awm0@published data-word-count=11><strong>Richard Beymer as Ben Horne and Russ Tamblyn as Dr. Jacoby</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/478/9cc/fefd8564027c97419b963cc61a32ad9b8b-22-twin-peaks-dana-ashbrook.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj30lgiz6007um0yezxcm7u9g@published data-word-count=91>If you went to get a snack, you could have missed either, but they’re back, the former still working at the Great Northern Lodge and the latter doing something far more mysterious in the woods involving spray paint and shovels. It seems likely that we haven’t seen the last of either, or Ben’s brother Jerry (David Patrick Kelly), also seen in one scene in episode one, espousing his love for edibles. Perhaps most surprisingly, we have yet to spot Ben’s daughter Audrey (Sherilyn Fenn), although she’s reported to return this season.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj30lgkot007pqgy6tz0napyv@published data-word-count=6><strong>Catherine Coulson as the Log Lady</strong></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4d2/729/3cf19538f18c7cb1590f7b88ab41183710-loglady.h473.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj30lgkfg007xm0yecwigalza@published data-word-count=68>Yes, that was the <a href=#>original Log Lady</a> on the phone, calling Hawk and getting an investigation started into what was missing from the Cooper files.

However, Watts, one of Lynch’s most beloved collaborators, will most likely stick around for a bit as Dougie Jones’s wife. In her scenes, she conveys a wonderful blend of conflicted emotions — angry at her husband’s disappearance on a gambling jaunt, but happy that he won a lot of money. Her delivery is perfect: “This is the most wonderful, horrible day of my life.” Lynch has revealed that another one of his muses, Laura Dern, will play a major role later this year, but she’s still waiting in the wings.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj30ligyv007wqgy6fi43l6fo@published data-word-count=5><strong>Ashley Judd as Beverly Paige</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4d2/729/3cf19538f18c7cb1590f7b88ab41183710-loglady.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj30ligbz007rqgy627k0j36q@published data-word-count=66>While some of the familiar faces of Twin Peaks: The Return feel like they have made all the impact they needed to in one or two scenes, it’s hard to believe that brief glimpse of Judd as Ben Horne’s assistant is the last we’ll see of her.
