Though Karl often had to travel for jobs, he made sure to include his kids in his work whenever he was home. “I remember my sister and I rehearsing all his songs from Gypsy with him after dinner every night,” Mila, 72, shared with Closer of her dad’s role in the 1962 musical. “He was goofy, warm and sweet.”</p><p>Even though Karl rose to superstardom in the 1950s, the Streetcar Named Desire actor didn’t necessarily look like the typical movie star. “I learned in my second year of drama school I was not a leading man — I was a character actor,” he once told <a href=#>The Los Angeles Times</a> in 2004. “So I thought, ‘I’d better be the best character actor around.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/karl-malden-family-exclusive03.jpg><p>That’s exactly what he became, bringing a workingman’s ethic to his career that he’d learned while toiling in the steel mills of Gary, Indiana, alongside his Serbian-immigrant father. At 22 in 1934, Karl quit studying acting. “When I told my father, he said, ‘Are you crazy? You want to give up a good job in the middle of the Depression?'” Karl recalled to the <a href=#>Associated Press</a> in 1962. “Thank God for my mother. She said to give it a try.”</p><p>Karl’s versatility as an actor became his calling card, as he played characters ranging from a streetwise priest in 1954’s On the Waterfront alongside lifelong close friend Marlon Brando, to a villainous rancher in director Blake Edwards’ 1971 Western Wild Rovers. “He picked parts that were different from each other, so he was never pigeonholed,” said Mila. “And he always threw himself into whatever he was doing 150 percent.”</p><p>He wasn’t above taking a gig doing TV commercials for American Express. “Laurence Olivier was doing an ad campaign for Polaroid cameras, so he figured, ‘Well, if Olivier can do it, I can do it,'” Carla says. “He shot one ad a week for 21 years, and he was happy to do it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/karl-malden-family-exclusive04.jpg><p>But Karl’s two daughters said their dad was happiest when he was with his family, which came to include great-grandchildren. “He was never cantankerous — he was always loving and grateful,” Carla marveled. “He considered himself enormously fortunate, and he was always surrounded by family who adored him.”</p><p>The Streets of San Francisco actor’s daughters said he left behind a legacy of love. “He had a really magnificent life,” Carla said. “It was beyond his wildest dreams.”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b><i>For more on your favorite celebs, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now — and be sure to </i></b><a href=#><span class=s2><b><i>sign up for our newsletter</i></b></span></a><b><i> for more exclusive news!</i></b></span></p><p>Be sure to check out and <a href=#>subscribe to our Classic TV & Film Podcast</a> for interviews with your favorite stars!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46kmKukXaKurbDEp6pmnJGqtKnAxKuqZqqVorKursSrZK2glZ6%2FbrDAnWSaq12WeqWxw6KamqyVmXqnrdOhnKtn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./outkast-producer-rico-wade-dies-suddenly-and-unexpectedly-huge-loss-to-the-world-of-music.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>OutKast producer Rico Wade dies 'suddenly and unexpectedly' - 'Huge loss to the world of music'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./delane-fitzgerald.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>DeLane Fitzgerald</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
