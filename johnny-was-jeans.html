However, StyleCaster may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>As someone who works from home most of the time, pulling on a <a href=#>pair of jeans</a> can feel like torture. Why would I trade my soft, everday <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">leggings</a> and cozy sweats for something so…stiff? But in an effort to elevate my spring style and reignite my passion for fashion, I decided to test out some brand-new denim designs from <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Johnny Was</a>—and to be honest, I was impressed.</p><p>The California-based brand is already known for creating cute wardrobe staples, like colorful, embroidered tops and breezy, printed dresses, so added <a href=# id=auto-tag_jeans data-tag=jeans>jeans</a> to the mix this past March felt like the perfect next step.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>“Our Denim Collection is a natural progression for&nbsp;Johnny&nbsp;Was&nbsp;as we continue to surprise and delight our customers with innovative offerings,” the company’s CEO, Rob Trauber, said in a press release. “Denim is a timeless staple in any wardrobe, and we are thrilled to infuse our unique blend of California-inspired design and craftsmanship into this iconic fabric.”</p><p>For the record, I’m only 5’0, which means I’m already kind of cautious when purchasing pants. When selecting the Johnny Was jeans I wanted to try, I decided to follow one of my tried-and-true <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>petite fashion</a> tricks: choosing cropped styles and wearing them as full-length bottoms.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that most of Johnny Was’ jeans include 1-2 percent elastane, a detail that, in my opinion, makes all the difference. They felt stretchy without being too loose, and at one point, I sat down to write an article and forgot I even had them on. They really were that comfy.</p><p>Of course, there are more reasons why I think Johnny Was jeans are worth shopping. Check out the four must-have styles that I recently tried, ahead, along with a few tips on how to work them into your everyday rotation.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do. Johnny Was is a STYLECASTER sponsor, however, all products in this article were independently selected by our editors.

Johnny Was also makes a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>darker-wash denim skirt</a>, which flares out toward the bottom rather than going straight down. It was easy to pull on and you could instantly tell it was made from quality materials—it felt neither too thin nor too heavy, solidifying its spot as a year-round, season-less staple.</p><p>With the transitional weather in mind, I styled my midi with a button-down and boots, giving it a sleek twist that would work for both occasional trips to the office and my weekend plans. However, as things heat up, I plan to keep things even more casual, wearing this versatile skirt with a basic T-shirt and strappy sandals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Johnny-Was-Jeans-4.jpg><p><strong>Sizes available: </strong>25 – 32<br><strong>Materials: </strong>98% organic cotton, 2% Elastane</p><p>Between the balletcore trend and Ariana Grande’s new Wicked-themed aesthetic, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>pink fashion</a> is still going strong. And while colorful jeans can be tricky to style, this <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>cropped pair</a> is light enough that working them into my outfits felt effortless instead of intimidating.</p><p>For this look, I decided to go the monochromatic route, wearing my jeans with a long-sleeved tee of a similar shade, then balancing things out with white sneakers. Alternatively, I would pair these bottoms with neutral pieces, allowing them to make even more of a statement.</p><p>While some may argue that skinny jeans are back, I’m forever a loose, wide-leg girl. I hate anything that feels too constricting on my legs, and the Sydney jeans actually made it easy to move around and relax. I also enjoyed the higher waist, which held me in and provided support as I went about my day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Johnny-Was-Jeans-1.jpg><p><strong>Sizes available: </strong>25 – 32<br><strong>Materials: </strong>65% organic cotton, 34% Tencel, 1% Elastane</p><p>A cropped boot-cut to some, but the perfect subtle flare on me! The dark wash made <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>these babies</a> feel extra fancy and elevated, and while they would no doubt make a great going-out pant (AKA the type you can style with sexy corset tops and sparkly designs), they can also amp up simple or casual tops.</p><p>I styled my Marseille jeans with a baggy crewneck sweatshirt, and while my look was on the laid-back side, the flare detail provided a fashion-forward twist. Plus, thanks to the soft and stretchy material, I didn’t mind wearing them for hours on end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Johnny-Was-Jeans-3.jpg><p><strong>Sizes available: </strong>25 – 32<br><strong>Materials: </strong>98% organic cotton, 2% Elastane</p><p>Remember the jeans I admittedly forgot I had on? These were them. Perfectly baggy with just the right amount of stretch, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Barcelona Boyfriend jean</a> could easily replace my go-to, everyday joggers (and that’s saying something). The design is loose up top before tapering toward the bottom, and although they were pictured as cuffed on the Johnny Was site, I’m happy to report you can style them however you’d like (so, naturally, I uncuffed them).</p><p>Since these bottoms were undeniably the most relaxed of the bunch, I decided that opposites should attract when selecting my outfit. I added a pearl-embellished cardigan and silver ballet flats, proving that even though boyfriend jeans are inherently casual, it’s possible to dress them up, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ywwdOfoK1lmZmyor%2BOam5tbGNqgHC2zqGlp7FdrK60ecmemKerXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./miranda-kerr-praises-sister-wife-katy-perry-shares-details-of-their-close-friendship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Miranda Kerr praises 'sister wife' Katy Perry, shares details of their close friendship</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wordscapes-level-855.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wordscapes Level 855 Answers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
