However, we've explained here why this happens and what you can do if it does.</p><h2 id=what-causes-your-macbook-39-s-battery-to-swell-or-expand>What Causes Your MacBook's Battery to Swell or Expand?</h2><p>There are many things that can cause lithium-ion batteries to expand and swell, but all are still mostly down to the chemicals packed in the battery. Here are some of the most common reasons your battery might swell:</p><h3 id=overcharging-and-heat>1. Overcharging and Heat</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/macbook-not-charging.jpg><p>Lithium-ion batteries are top-of-the-line technology that powers the modern electric world. Charging your battery is necessary to use your device, but you must be careful not to overcharge it as it causes the battery to overheat. Yes, <a href=#>it's bad to keep charging your MacBook all the time</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The chemicals in lithium-ion (or Li-ion) batteries release toxic gas in a process called outgassing when you run too much current through the cell. Overheating can cause harmful gas to get trapped in pockets of membrane and battery layers. Consequently, too much gas can cause batteries to explode.</p><p>This is one of the reasons most experts recommend slow charging rather than fast charging, as quick charging builds up more heat than its slower alternative.</p><p>Furthermore, lithium-ion batteries lose potency if they are frequently below 20% and above 80%. Some Apple devices have software features that <a href=#>stop or slow down charging at 80%</a>, improving battery life and reducing the risk of swelling or fire.</p><p>External environments can also contribute to heat. Leaving your MacBook in places with high temperatures, like your car parked under the hot sun, a room with no ventilation, or just blocking the vents by using it on a pillow, can cause your laptop's internals to get hot. This heat can affect your battery and cause it to swell and explode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=battery-impact>2.

You must be very careful about handling your MacBook. If you're one of those people who think they have indestructible MacBooks, well, your battery is quite destructible.</p><p>When exposed, lithium-ion batteries can react with air (especially hot air) and release gases like methane, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen, which are both flammable and toxic.</p><p>Tempted to replace or tamper with the faulty battery yourself? We strongly recommend giving it to an expert because you may accidentally remove the battery's outer layer and expose it, putting you at risk of a fire hazard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To reduce the risk of impact, you can <a href=#>physically protect your MacBook with these six tips</a>.</p><h3 id=fake-batteries>3.

However, don't be tempted to cut costs and get low-grade batteries if you ever want to replace your battery.</p><p>If your MacBook battery replacement battery price is too good to be true, then the odds are that it is. Apple's original batteries are tried and trusted to give you as much safety and power as possible. We can't say the same for other battery sources, and you may get something that doesn't meet the required safety standards that Apple's batteries are known for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These substandard batteries can be very weak and swell quicklyâ€”even with correct usage. While you can relatively easily replace a swelling battery, it can damage other parts of your computer before you even detect it.</p><p>There are many stories of fake MacBook batteries swelling up and breaking through the trackpad or even damaging parts of the motherboard.</p><p>If you buy a pre-owned MacBook, you might want to check if your battery is original before using it. On the other hand, you could just buy your MacBook from a reputable source. We have some recommendations on <a href=#>where to buy refurbished MacBooks</a>.</p><h2 id=what-to-do-if-your-macbook-39-s-battery-is-swollen>What to Do if Your MacBook's Battery Is Swollen</h2><p>Bad batteries are not just inconvenient; they are also dangerous. We've listed some actions you can take if you notice your battery swelling up.</p><h3 id=safety-first>1. Safety First</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/regularly-clean-macbook-with-microfibre.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Your battery is not more important than you. So, prioritize your safety and the safety of others before you think of replacing your battery. Swollen batteries can lead to fire or harmful gas emissions, and you should give your MacBook a sniff to ensure no smoke or awful smells is coming out of it.</p><p>Once you confirm any smoky smell or strange popping sounds coming from your MacBook, it means that the device is on fire. Quickly take the MacBook to a well-ventilated space and put it on a non-flammable surface like a concrete floor.</p><p>You can put sand on it to lessen the flames or use a fire extinguisher. However, the flame reaction may continue until the battery's fuel finishes.</p><p>If the battery explosion happens while the battery is not in the MacBook, then safely put the battery in a fireproof container or a container filled with sand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=take-it-to-the-genius-bar>2.

Please also avoid putting the battery in contact with water as that may also cause an explosion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lastly, do not dispose of the MacBook battery in your household trash. Batteries are toxic and should only be disposed of at e-trash centers. If your MacBook battery finds its way to a compost heap or traditional waste facilities, it might ignite, cause a fire, or other environmental hazards.</p><p>The best thing to do with your now useless MacBook or battery is to give it to your nearest Apple Store. They can handle hazardous parts and use salvageable parts for other products.</p><h2 id=prevention-is-better-than-replacement>Prevention Is Better Than Replacement</h2><p>It might seem a bit inconvenient at first, but you should make an effort to ensure your battery never swells in the first place.
