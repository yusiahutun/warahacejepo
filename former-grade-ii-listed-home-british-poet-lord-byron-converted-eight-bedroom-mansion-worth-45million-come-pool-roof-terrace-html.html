class=mol-para-with-font><span>Lord Byron, born George Gordon Noel in 1788, was an English romantic poet who wrote some of the most famous works in history.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The sixth Baron Byron, born in London – who inherited his title at just three-years-old, when his father died – shot to fame almost overnight in 1812 when his lengthy narrative of 'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage' was published.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Lord Byron, who spent his early years in Aberdeen, attended Harrow School and Cambridge University before spending two years travelling around the Mediterranean in 1809.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He returned to England two years later and it was within 12 months that the first two parts of 'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage' were released – making his name.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Following his fame, more of his works were published including The Giaour, The Bride of Abydos (1813), Parisina and The Siege of Corinth (1815).</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The poet's life was not without controversy, however, and in 1814 his half-sister Augusta gave birth to a daughter – rumoured to be his.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He also indulged in an affair with Lady Caroline Lamb, who famously called him 'mad, bad and dangerous to know'.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>A year later he married Annabella Milbanke, with whom he had a daughter, but the couple split in 1816.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The same year, following the separation, rumours surrounding his suspected relationship with half-sister Augusta and amid claims of debt, Lord Byron fled England and never returned.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He travelled to Belgium and then on to Switzerland before moving on to Italy, where he lived for more than six years.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>During his time in Venice, he wrote some of his most notable works, including 'Don Juan' (1819-1824), but was also plagued by rumours of several affairs.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Mary Shelley, with whom he shared a house in Italy for a time, was said to be appalled at his behaviour, after he worked his way through countesses, chambermaids and aristocrats' or cobblers' wives.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>After his time in Italy, Lord Byron chose to move to Greece, where he joined insurgents fighting against the Ottoman Empire.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He paid for the refitting of the Greek fleet and refunded part of the ragged revolutionary army after arriving in Greece in 1823.</span></p><img
