a blow that has seen Stacy's boyfriend go into a 'depressive state'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'm fine with being with someone with a prosthetic leg, if I had met him and he had had it already that's fine. I'm not superficial like that,' Stacy said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's the fact that I've only known him six months and the amount of physical therapy he's going to have to go through and it's also that he's not taking it well. I'm having to sacrifice so much for this person I've literally only known for six months.'</p>&nbsp;I don't know whether to do it now before the surgery or do I wait until the surgery is done but then I'm stuck having to help with the physio<p class=mol-para-with-font>Stacy said before the accident she was 'fully invested' in the relationship, and the pair were 'in love' and and had even planned future travels together.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If we were together for years or he was my husband that's different but I'm in this pickle,' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He has friends and family that can help but I just don't think I can lock myself into this. This is something I didn't sign up for.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kyle sided with Stacy saying it must be 'driving her crazy' that everyone has put her in a 'carer position' however, Jackie wasn't convinced and asked Stacy how she would go about breaking it off with him if that's what she decides to do.</p><img id=i-e955186fe530d1e3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/09/08/01/62183411-11191343-Stacey_said_she_wasn_t_emotionally_invested_enough_in_the_relati-a-26_1662598350965.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Stacey&nbsp;said she wasn't 'emotionally invested' enough in the relationship to take on supporting her partner of five months through the emotional and physical trauma of losing a limb" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Stacey&nbsp;said she wasn't 'emotionally invested' enough in the relationship to take on supporting her partner of five months through the emotional and physical trauma of losing a limb</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'That's what I don't know â€“ I don't know whether to do it now before the surgery or do I wait until the surgery is done but then I'm stuck having to help with the physio.

He's just lost a leg. He'll need help for the first little bit but then I'm sure he'll be pretty independent.
