In 2019, Australia exported just over 300,000 tonnes of beef to China, before informal Chinese trade measures such as suspensions on imports from <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">specific Australian abattoirs</span></a> occurred over the course of 2020. Exports were also affected by other factors including lower beef production caused by a seasonal rebuilding of herds.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">‘Progress being made’</h3>Improved relations since last year’s change of government in Canberra had <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">raised hopes</span></a> among Australian exporters that some of the import bans may now be lifted. Current Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said this week that the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Australian Trade Minister Don Farrell said on Thursday in an interview with state broadcaster ABC that “in almost every aspect where we’ve had trade blockages or disputes there appears to be progress being made”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But he seemed to admit that this has yet to trickle down much to the country’s exporters when he added that his “job is to convert those discussions into practical outcomes for Australian businesses”.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure

e1346ty31">This was not the result of “free market outcomes” but trade diverted for political reasons, according to Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who said Australia could feel justifiably aggrieved.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=#

datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“However, since Australia clearly desires to remain close to the US, it seems highly unlikely that Canberra will raise this issue politically with the Biden administration,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As such, you can say that … American security

the effect of increasing US market share, Stephen Olson, a former trade negotiator and senior research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation, said Australian officials didn’t have a legitimate “complaint” as all countries compete to increase their export competitiveness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The purchase commitments contained in the phase one agreement were an unusually blunt mechanism to achieve this objective, but conceptually, it is understood that this is the goal of the game,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, geopolitical shifts could turn things around, Olson said, pointing to recent improvements in bilateral relations.</p><figure

could also benefit from a ban on beef exports to China that Brazil self-imposed last month, said Andrew Smith, head of agribusiness development at Australia’s Rural Bank.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This could mean China will look for alternatives and likely will increase its month-on-month imports of Australian beef should the import ban on Brazilian beef continue,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=#

they had requested a revision of the protocol that triggered the ban, imposed after a case of mad cow disease was found in the northern state of Para in compliance with a bilateral sanitary agreement signed with China in 2015.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Smith said the US may also reduce beef exports later this year as producers look to
