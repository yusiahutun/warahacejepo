Music, movies, and books that you buy from companies like Amazon are not technically yoursâ€”you have merely been granted a license to use the content.</p><p>Put yourself in the shoes of one Amazon user, who in 2012 had her entire Kindle library (and Amazon account) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">permanently deleted for a supposed breach of terms</a>. We don't know whether she did anything wrong, but we do know she was several hundred dollars out of pocket. All her beloved books were irrevocably gone, with no way to retrieve them.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Here's what Amazon said in an email to her at the time:</p><p>Per our Conditions of Use which state in part: Amazon.co.uk and its affiliates reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders at their sole discretion.</p><p>While we are unable to provide detailed information on how we link related accounts, please know that we have reviewed your account on the basis of the information provided and regret to inform you that it will not be reopened.</p><p>The problem could have been entirely avoided if she had removed the DRM restrictions.</p><p>Why? Because she could have backed up her files on her local machine. Amazon might still have deleted her account, but the content that she spent so much money on would still be in her possession.</p><h2 id=different-types-of-ebook-drm>Different&nbsp;Types of Ebook DRM</h2><p>Generally, ebooks use four different DRM schemes. They are:</p><li><strong>Adobe's ADEPT DRM</strong>: It can be applied to EPUBs and PDFs, most third-party ebook readers will be able to read it. Books purchased from Barnes and Noble use this format.</li><li><strong>Amazon DRM</strong>: Amazon's format is applied to AZW8, KF8, and Mobipocket files. Again,&nbsp;most mainstream readers can understand it.</li><li><strong>Apple FairPlay DRM</strong>: Apple's approach can only be applied to EPUB files and can only be read by Apple's iBooks app.</li><li><strong>Marlin DRM</strong>: An open industry group that includes Panasonic, Philips, Samsung, and Sony developed the Marlin system.</li><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=how-to-remove-drm-from-most-ebooks>How to Remove DRM From Most Ebooks</h2><p>Given the diversity of ebook publishers and ebook file formats, it's not surprising that there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. There are <a href=#>many ways to remove ebooks' DRM</a>.</p><p>If you buy your books through Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or the other typical <a href=#>well-known ebook stores</a>, the best solution is Calibre.</p><p>Calibre is a free and open-source ebook library management application that's packed full of useful features. For this process, you'll need <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Calibre</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">apprenticealf's DRM removal plugins</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=install-the-software>Install the Software</h3><p>Install the software and fire up the app for the first time. When prompted, select which folders contain your existing ebook purchases. If you don't have one yet, create it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/calibre-choose-folder.png><p>Next, you'll be asked to <a class=no-callout href=#>select your ereader device</a>. The list includes all the major manufacturers. Don't worry if you have more than one device, you can change this setting to alternate between them later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/calibre-choose-device.png><p>If you want to be able to send ebooks from Calibre straight to your device, fill in your associated emails on the next screen. For the purposes of the DRM removal process, you can skip this step.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Finally, click <strong>Finish</strong> and the app will boot.</p><h3 id=install-the-plugins>Install the Plugins</h3><p>Calibre supports a variety of plugins that perform different functions. To remove the DRM, you need apprenticealf's DRM Removal Tool for Ebooks. The latest version is available for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">download from GitHub</a>.</p><p>Download the file and unzip its contents. Now head back to Calibre and click the <strong>Preferences</strong> icon on the top menu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/calibre-preferences-670x499.png><p>Click <strong>Plugins</strong> on the bottom row of the pop-up screen, then select <strong>Load Plugin from File</strong> in the bottom right-hand corner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/calibre-plugin-465x500.png><p>Find your unzipped file and navigate to <strong>DeDRM_calibre_plugin > DeDRM_calibre_plugin</strong>.

It will not work if you're converting books between formats. Therefore, if you have already imported DRM books you'll need to remove them from the app and re-import them.</p><p>The DRM removal is the simplest part of the whole process. Just drag-and-drop your ebooks from your e-reader (or local drive) into Calibre's main window; the software will automatically delete the DRM. If you're pulling them from a Kindle, drag all the files associated with each book and click <strong>None</strong> when warned about duplicates.</p><h2 id=how-to-remove-drm-from-apple-books>How to Remove DRM From Apple Books</h2><p>Unfortunately, Apple users keen to remove the DRM from their ebooks face a much more limited choice of tools.</p><p>The only reliable method is to use the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TunesKit iBook DRM removal tool</a>. This will set you back $30, but if you've got thousands of ebooks, it's a price worth paying.</p><p>After you've downloaded and installed the app, you'll need to download all your iBooks to your local machine.</p><p>Once you've got them saved, just drag-and-drop them into the DRM removal software and click <strong>Convert</strong>. Simple, effective, but unfortunately not free.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=how-to-remove-drm-from-overdrive-ebooks>How to Remove DRM From OverDrive Ebooks</h2><p>Many public libraries in the United States use the OverDrive system to let you rent digital copies of books. Books that you borrow on OverDrive use Adobe's DRM toolâ€”but don't worry, it is still possible to remove the DRM from library books.</p><p>Firstly, you need to download a copy of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Adobe Digital Editions</a> and open the ebook you want to edit within the app.</p><p>Next, download a copy of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ebook DRM Removal</a> tool. Open the app, select the EPUB file you want to work with from the&nbsp;Digital Editions folder, and hit the <strong>Remove</strong> button. Give the process a few seconds to complete and you will have removed the OverDrive DRM. You should be able to send the ebook to your Kindle and read it without issues.</p><p>Remember, even though it's not illegal, removing the DRM on library books is certainly morally questionable. Think about your actions before you begin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fp7Kuu9WeZJ2qnWKyt7HRsmSemp%2BkuG671qdm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-dont-love-my-husband-anymore.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I Don't Love My Husband Anymore, But I'm Scared to Leave Him</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hearing-for-man-convicted-in-carrie-olsons-2015-death-set-in-rock-island-county.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Hearing for man convicted in Carrie Olsons 2015 death set in Rock Island County</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
