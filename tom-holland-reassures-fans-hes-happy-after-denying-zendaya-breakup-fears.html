This follows rumors <a href=#>Tom Holland</a> and his girlfriend had parted ways. Tom and star of the <a href=#>TV</a> show Euphoria, Zendaya, have been together since 2021 after they were spotted kissing in a car. They have known each other for many years and the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> starred as love interests in the three most recent live-action Spider-Man installments.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1258362974-1024x693.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tom-is-entering-the-next-chapter>Tom is ‘entering the next chapter’</h2><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star attended the red carpet alone, though he was later joined by his brother at the event.</p><p>Talking to Entertainment Tonight during the arrivals for the <a href=#>awards show</a>, the 27-year-old explained his plans for the future and said he was feeling “secure” and “happy.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;feel very secure and happy and I’m enjoying life,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Bruno Mars and his girlfriend face trouble after ‘living separate lives’</a></p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> added of his work: “It’s definitely the next chapter, [and] I think the beginning of my career is sort of coming to a close with sort of getting to that next step.

However, it has been noted he still follows her.</p><p>It further caused panic, as the pair hadn’t been seen out and about together since October.</p><p>Tom and <a href=#>Zendaya</a>, 27, were photographed shopping for groceries last month, but since then there hasn’t been anything else about them being together. They have, however, had outings since then … just without each other.</p><p>Tom attending the awards show alone might not be all it seems though, as we did get some clarity on what they’ve been up to and whether they were still together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-have-zendaya-and-tom-holland-broken-up>Have Zendaya and Tom Holland broken up?</h2><p>After weeks of speculation, we might be getting some answers.</p><p>Tom Holland was asked by a TMZ reporter if he and Zendaya had split and gave a short but definite answer. They caught him as he and a friend walked down an alleyway to get to his car and were able to ask him the question which has been on fans’ minds.</p><p>“No, absolutely not,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> them. Phew!</p><p>A source told the outlet: “Just because we don’t SEE them together, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not.”</p><p>They reportedly spent New Year together, and their loved ones were not informed of any breaking up.
