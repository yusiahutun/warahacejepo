Per authorities, the victim was last seen by her family on December 31, 2023 and texted her twin sister saying she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>"had met someone in Ouachita Parish and was going to move there."</strong></a> She also sent a friend a message saying she had made it to West Monroe, Louisiana and she would talk to him soon, but he received no further contact after January 2.</p><p>DNA collected from Turner's sister and mother were then used to confirm her identity.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The West Monroe Police Department</strong></a><strong> </strong>claimed<strong> </strong>forensic data showed Turner had "engaged in a romantic relationship over text message" with someone from West Monroe. Per the arrest affidavit, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>KATC</strong></a>, Turner and Holland were communicating over the TextNow app and arranged for him to pick her up at her mother's home on January 1.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:857e6753-0b85-4d14-a77b-b98b1d115794 data-container-ref=toofab:article:917da4d3-5470-4579-94ba-642eceaa326e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/56/5by4/2024/04/24/56a745e4ef954c10a9691c8732c8e297_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">10-Year-Old Boy Calls 9-1-1 After Waking Up to 'Massacre' of Entire Family</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Her phone allegedly stopped transmitting the following night, just before midnight, as it used a WiFi network near the suspect's apartment, said the affidavit. Holland's car, meanwhile, was seen on traffic cameras near where the remains were later discovered. The docs also say a search warrant was executed at his home on Tuesday, where authorities allegedly found blood on a mattress and on the floor -- before Holland was taken into custody.</p><p>During interviews with the suspect, he allegedly admitted to murdering Turner inside the apartment, with the affidavit saying he said he "killed her during a sex act," before dismembering her, putting her remains in bags and tossing them into a tributary of the Ouachita River. He also allegedly told authorities he threw away the knives used for the dismemberment, as well as all Turner's possessions.</p><p>In a GoFundMe page set up by Sheryl's twin sister, she was remembered as being "full of life and a sweetheart" who "didn't bother nobody." She added that a part of her "was taken when this monster did that to her." In her obituary, she was also called "a shining light to all who knew her, with a kind and loving personality that radiated through her beautiful smile and touched the hearts of those around her."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6d2104fe-5e87-4342-a8c6-7e6acb18bb24 data-container-ref=toofab:article:917da4d3-5470-4579-94ba-642eceaa326e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/df/5by4/2024/04/23/dfd4cb07e4974a199fd749852179e657_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC 6</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Man Kills Girlfriend, Shows Video of Body to Her Ex Before Driving to Police Station with Corpse: Cops</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma25foq6vecCrqZ6rpJqxbrXNZqSuqpSav267xWauqKWRo3qstculnJ1lmaN6tLHXZpicrF2Wu6V5w6Kqpp2dl7KzscNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mom-64-stabbed-death-san-francisco-apartment-building-son-slams-citys-severe-problems-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mom, 64, stabbed to death in San Francisco apartment building - niece slams city's 'severe problems'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./660982d4e2704e54a38b4583-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>La Libreta de Van Gaal: &amp;quot;Racismo anti-Vinicius&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
