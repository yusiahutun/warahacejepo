Locals say the real number is much higher. The last high-profile disappearance that made the news was in 2016, when American tourist Justin Alexander disappeared while on a trek down from the Mantalai lake.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Parvati Valley’s streets are testament to this.

Many visitors come in search of tranquillity and solitude, especially those who travel to the valley’s upper reaches which are inaccessible by motorised transport.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Agarwal’s brother, Abhishek, said he was one such tourist. “When he told us he wanted to go there, we wondered why he insisted on going alone,” he said. “I told him to take someone along, but he said he wanted to go alone, to find peace and solitude.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Paradise lost: the rise and fall of India’s colonial era hill stations</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Legends, myths, ascetics</strong></h3>Another part of the valley’s appeal are the many legends and myths associated with it, especially in Hinduism. One such legend suggests the Hindu god Lord Shiva, one of the principal deities in the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">religion</span></a>, meditated here for 3,000 years and was so spellbound by its beauty that he named it after his partner, the goddess Parvati.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, those drawn to the valley by its spirituality have occasionally met dark ends.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In August 2016, the American traveller Alexander, who was living in Parvati Valley, decided to trek to the upper reaches of the Himalayan range, to Mantalai lake which lies at 4,000 metres. Alexander, who had been living in a cave, decided to go hiking with a Hindu ascetic, ostensibly to learn more about meditation techniques. On September 3, that year, Alexander was spotted apparently on the return leg of the trek, but he was never seen again. “He never made it,” reads an announcement on his Facebook page, posted a month later, by his friends and family.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alexander had grown close to the ascetic, Sat Narayan Giri, and had featured him on his social media posts where he described the holy man as someone so otherworldly that he had “even cut off his penis”. Alexander seemed enamoured by the “magical powers” that ascetics like Giri were rumoured to have.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After Alexander’s disappearance, the local police arrested Giri. Just days before custody was to expire, Giri was found hanging from the bars of his police cell. Five and a half years later, there is no word on Alexander.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/25/5f09fb2c-dfe6-4d5b-888f-4637874ee2ed_22810d24.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Tricky terrain</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Adding to the murky and mysterious ways of the valley is its terrain. The valley’s upper reaches have no roads fit for motor vehicles; the only way to reach them are by trekking, often along precariously narrow pathways on tall mountain slopes with precipitous drops.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Local hiking experts are often co-opted to search for those who go missing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The valley can be treacherous, because the slopes get narrower as you go higher up,” said Manu Mahajan, a mountaineer who belongs to the Himalayan Rescue Mission.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mahajan has taken part in various searches over the years. Usually, success means retrieving the remains of a person who has died.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is so dangerous in spots that one small mistake and you end up in the Parvati river, thousands of feet below,” he said, “and nothing that goes into the Parvati ever comes back.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/25/4ed80f74-3f94-4b4e-b014-f33294e4f49f_22810d24.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the Manikaran police station, a nondescript ground structure manned by a handful of police stations, Agarwal’s disappearance evokes a strong sense of familiarity and foreboding – its walls are covered with posters of people who have gone missing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The police station overlooks the expansive valley and the mountain ranges that include popular trekking destinations like Kheerganga, where Agarwal was headed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Police officials there, not willing to be named, questioned the wisdom of Agarwal’s decision to trek to Kheerganga alone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“His family told us that he had never trekked before,” said a police official.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Tourists have to become responsible and have local guides and porters who can help them on such treks and not risk going alone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/25/a7fff156-5930-4339-9dc3-e350bafc60fb_22810d24.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">More intrigue</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the Agarwal family dismiss such suggestions and are angry at what they believe was a botched investigation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The family has done what it could – hired a private rescue team, spent hundreds of dollars looking for their son, mounted social media campaigns, pressured the country’s high offices to use their influence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the police, they said, had not done enough.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Even the CCTV footage showing Agarwal in a shop, buying winter clothes, was obtained from the shop by us and not the police,” said his sister, Manica.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even as the family fights their disappointment, they try to keep their hopes up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In this battle between hopelessness and hope, a series of phone calls have added to the mystery while possibly shedding light on what might have happened to Agarwal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More than two months after Agarwal went missing, the family received calls from two Indian trekkers, calling from separate parts of the country. They said they had seen posters about Agarwal’s disappearance on social media and wanted to help.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Ani Ashekian's journal offers new clues after four years of silence</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They had not met Agarwal, nor did they know his whereabouts, but they did have information that could help the family understand better what could have happened. They had trekked in the same area as solo travellers who had gone missing and believed they had escaped a similar fate by a whisker.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both trekkers had come across a group of young women who sought to “lure” solo male travellers trekking in the mountains. One of the trekkers had even consumed something they gave to him, only to wake up three days later, with no memory of what happened afterwards. However, adding to the mystery, the young women had apparently not stolen anything from the trekker.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They told us that this gang of girls are always on the prowl for solo male travellers,” Manica said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the family, the explanation seems plausible. After all, Agarwal was alone and a big city businessman, carrying cash and his bank cards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My brother was someone who had a pure heart and trusted people easily,” Manica added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Maybe they have done something similar with bhaiyya [my brother].”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGpqb2FtgXh7z5qpr5mknnq3rculnLJlmaOxqq3SZpmeqp2qsaJ506ugmqaXobJursCcoqmZk6Cys7%2BMnaCsmaClsqK%2BwKeang%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nicole-snooki-polizzi-marries-jionni-lavalle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nicole &amp;quot;Snooki&amp;quot; Polizzi Marries Jionni LaValle -- See Stunning Wedding Dress!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-babcock.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Michael Babcock dating?
