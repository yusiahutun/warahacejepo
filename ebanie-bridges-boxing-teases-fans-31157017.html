She posted a sticker which read “OMG” over the top of her body and uploaded a caption which read: “Click to see what’s underneath.” While Bridges’ ex-rivals have criticised her raunchy social media posts, Bridges is a passionate believer that all women should be empowered to do and dress however they like.</p><p>When asked if she had a message for her critics in an exclusive interview with <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Daily Star Sport</a> in 2022, she said: “The message is ‘you should not be telling people what they should or shouldn’t be doing’.</p><p><b><i>What is your reaction to Ebanie Bridges' latest post?

You can be beautiful, you can be feminine, you can be taken seriously. You can say you are getting objectified or whatever, but if I choose to wear that, then maybe I want to be looked at. If I didn’t want to be looked at I would cover myself up.</p><p>“I think the people making those opinions are the people that would never do that themselves, because it’s just not them. They wouldn’t get up in a bikini, they wouldn’t go and do ring, they wouldn’t go and be grid girls, they wouldn’t do anything like this. So they are then having a voice for people who want to do it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Gor6Kml2Syo63NopxmmqKesaix0maZqLCZo7RuwMSaqp6rXZuur7%2BMbGhqbWdlfng%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-watson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emily Watson</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrity-deaths-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrity deaths: Stars who have died in 2024 so far</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
