The fear of being labelled as a feminist in South Korea is real.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“The word ‘feminism’ has become a dirty word to a lot of individuals in Korea, and people are unwilling to recognise – and are uncomfortable confronting – the deeply rooted patriarchy that has driven society for so long,” she said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>South Korea remains deeply patriarchal and scores poorly for gender equality among advanced nations. The country has the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">worst gender pay gap</a> among OECD countries and has consistently ranked last on the Economist’s <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Glass Ceiling Index</a>, which measures where women have the best and worst chances of equal treatment at work.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Women often face strong societal pressures to give up their careers after childbirth, and sex crimes against women are rampant in a criminal justice system that often <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">appears to give light sentences</a> to perpetrators.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1><a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Yoon Suk Yeol</a>, now the country’s president, disavowed the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">label of feminist</a> when he was running for office. He has previously suggested <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">feminism was to blame</a> for the country’s birthrate, currently <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the world’s lowest</a>, and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">stated</a> that South Korea has “no structural gender discrimination”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Film critic Youn Sung-Eun said South Koreans may agree on gender equality in principle, but there are factions within the conservative society that strongly oppose what they perceive as “radical feminism”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“In this context, Greta Gerwig’s gender equality education is not very appealing,” said Youn, who has completed a doctorate in film studies, on some of the potential reasons for its underperformance. “Since <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Barbie</a> is intended to be an entertaining movie, presenting such sensitive themes prominently might not resonate well.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Ahead of Barbie’s release, localised Korean versions of the posters were missing the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">original iconic slogans</a> “Barbie is everything” and “He’s just Ken”. They were simplified to and showed only the characters’ names. This <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">sparked criticism</a> for allegedly undermining the film’s female-empowering message. After the criticism emerged in April, Warner Brothers Korea said the move was not intentional and that it had focused on just the images and names of the character during the early stages of its promotional campaign.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In recent years, feminism in South Korea has morphed into a negative concept associated with radical behaviour, a perception that has gained traction in popular male-dominated online communities, and now in wider society.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>According to a 2019 survey by <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">local media outlet SisaIN</a>, 62.3% of men in their 20s do not believe feminism is a movement to achieve gender equality. Some 78.9% of men in their 20s agreed with a statement that it was about “female supremacy”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>South Korea <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">was ranked</a> 99th out of 146 countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index in 2022.</p><figure id=10e49264-1b07-49eb-a40d-aed67ca8f74a data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><a href=# data-ignore=global-link-styling aria-hidden=true tabindex=-1 class="open-lightbox dcr-13fd1ms"><span class=dcr-194i6pr>View image in fullscreen</span></a><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>America Ferrera, Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie attend the Seoul premiere of Barbie.

The film has already attracted more than 2 million viewers since coming out on 26 July.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Korea is a unique market – some films like Elemental overperform, while others do the opposite, which we are seeing with Barbie. This is also true of films like Star Wars, which are closely connected to American popular culture but <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">do not perform well here</a>.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Barbie has received a mixed reception across Asia, though for a different reason. The film <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">was banned in Vietnam</a> due to a scene depicting disputed Chinese territorial claims on a map. The Philippines also <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">took issue</a>. On the other hand, the film has reportedly seen <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">increased screenings</a> in China.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK%2Bfp7mle5FpaWxnkaq0cHyRaJmaqpKesm65zq%2BgnmWWobyxv4yspq6smGK4sL7EmmSfnZ2eu6q%2FzA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tommy-caldwell.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tommy Caldwell</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./creality-k1-max-3d-printer-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 3D Printer of My Dreams Finally Exists</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
