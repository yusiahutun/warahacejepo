I remember saving money so I could buy the different issues.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She attributed the excitement over the launch to a “hunger for recognition internationally”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If we’re not winning in other areas, we excel in pageants, boxing, and singing. The arrival of Vogue Philippines gives us the chance to be more present in the international fashion scene,” Alegre said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said the “obsession with pageants and beauty” came from Filipinos’ search for identity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Alegre, many Filipinos’ definition of beauty was “mestiza and mestizo” – [fair-skinned] – a reflection of the country’s centuries of colonial rule under the Spanish, Americans and Japanese.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indeed, given previous controversies, the new magazine is likely to be watched closely for its cultural sensitivities, not least among them the skin tones of the models it uses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2020, Vogue editor-in-chief and artistic director for Condé Nast Anna Wintour admitted making “mistakes” on race-related issues, saying that staff members had faced “hurtful and intolerant” behaviour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Employees have spoken about the challenges they faced as people of colour and criticised Vogue for neglecting diversity in its models, staff and contributors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That controversy won’t be the only hurdle the magazine faces. Like printed media worldwide, newspapers and book publishers in the Philippines face an era of declining revenues. In 2020, at least 13 community newspapers suspended their print operations to cut losses, ABS-CBN News reported. The same year, the book publishing industry lost US$3.6 billion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/13/0b6110fc-69f2-4165-99c5-5879e5c703cf_e3cd9334.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both issues – the new magazine’s cultural sensitivity and its profitability – will be keenly watched as an indication of the climate ahead for the industry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As a creative worker, I can’t help but frame the launch as a labour issue. With the issues publishing workers face in pay equity and stable employment, not only locally but internationally, what can we expect from Vogue Philippines in that regard,” said freelance writer and director Apa Agbayani.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Agbayani said he believed in the role of cultural journalism to document the times, tell stories and produce meaningful critiques. Whether the economics were in place to enable that vision was another matter, however.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is that potential to do that and there are many writers, photographers, editors, and artists who go into publishing with this dream. But I think that you cannot foster a meaningful environment for creative work without a living wage for creative workers,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So more than thinking about the prestige, I’m left with questions about how it is going to run. How will it be for creative workers working there?”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">A Philippine Cinderella: from domestic worker to Miss Universe?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">David, the photographer who grew up reading Vogue, said the magazine could be an opportunity for Filipino creatives. However, she cautioned that whether it was ultimately successful depended on how it adapted to younger audiences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I used to hang out with fashion photographers, they would get so excited when talking about Vogue India and Vogue China, even wanting to move to those countries,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But when I heard that Vogue Philippines was going to launch, I was thinking about how this would be handled. In terms of creative direction, what are their strategies? Because the way markets consume media today is so different from five to 10 years ago. Frankly, titles like Vogue, I’m not sure if they are still relevant to the younger set.”</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2019/09/20/pageant_-_plain.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">09:45</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Filipino Cinderella story: a journey from domestic helper to beauty queen</p><p>Filipino Cinderella story: a journey from domestic helper to beauty queen</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">David, who also works as a senior content strategist, said the internet was “like water for web-born youth”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“TikTok had a Vogue filter and people would use it, but when we asked them if they had heard of Vogue, they said they hadn’t.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wonder how Vogue will fit in the media diet of the Filipinos. What is the magazine feature equivalent for this generation?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alegre, the lecturer, warned that Filipino audiences were thrifty. “A lot of factors can affect the readership. Sometimes magazines don’t get sold upon their release. They are bought as back issues because they are cheaper,” she added.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">What’s behind the Philippine obsession with beauty queens?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Given such barriers to success, any fashion magazine today needed to cater to diversity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Said Alegre: “It must expand what beauty means and be not colourist, not xenophobic, not homophobic. Beauty is not just for cisgender people and for the elite.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLmqssSsq7KklWKwtrjTrqmeZ5Gnwaqvy55mbGlmaH93hI6vpqCtlWK9qbXLoqepoZ6awG6x15ygrZ2jYrStrcyorKtln5fApr%2FSnptmppGptrC6jKmpoqak</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-its-like-to-work-in-brothel.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What It's Like to Work in Brothel</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./john-stamos-don-rickles-129860.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>RIPJohn Stamos Pays Tribute to His Mom With a Sweet Photo of Her With Don Rickles</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
