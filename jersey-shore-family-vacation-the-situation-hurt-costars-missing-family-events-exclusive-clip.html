At the bash, she made comments about how everyone else should have shown up, while Mike admitted to feeling "a little upset." Mike then relayed Angelina's comments to <a href=#><strong>Jenni "JWoww" Farley</strong></a>, who said it seemed like Pivarnick "wanted to make the event about the rest of them not attending." As a result, Jenni and the other girls -- <a href=#><strong>Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Deena Nicole Cortese</strong></a><strong>,</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Samantha "Sammi Sweetheart" Giancola</strong></a> -- all <a href=#><strong>turned on</strong></a> Angelina.</p><p>However, the store opening was the second event the girls -- sans Angelina -- missed. The ladies also weren't present for the "baby day," in which Mike and Lauren introduced the group to their <a href=#><strong>second child</strong></a>, a baby girl named Mia.</p><p>Lauren suggested that Angelina's "comments hit a nerve," to which Angelina agreed, asking, "if they think they were right about what they did, why would it have hit a nerve?"</p><p>"Maybe they were upset with themselves, and you sort of pointed it out, and maybe they should have showed up for a friend," Mike replied.</p><p>In a confessional, Lauren said, "Did Angelina say things that upset the girls? Yes. Did Angelina say anything that wasn't true? No."</p><p>Mike admitted it "definitely bothered" him that the girls were absent for two events, especially when he and Lauren introduced their baby girl.</p><p>"Most people don't show up for you, you know what I mean? And it does hurt if someone doesn't show up for a baby event, [it] definitely hurts a lot," he said.</p><p>"Two events in a row," Sitch added in a confessional. "That upset me, but I was just too scared to admit how I feel, you know?"</p><p>When Angelina said the girls "owe [him] an apology," Mike said he tries to "give people the benefit of the doubt." While Pivarnick noted it's commendable that Mike is "being very positive," she believed he was "guarding" himself.</p><p>"I am," he admitted in reply. "I'm trying to manage expectations, I guess, to a certain extent."</p><p>Mike continued to share his feelings about the situation in a confessional, telling the cameras, "I was really hurt more than I let on to during that store opening, and I know that they had their excuses, and they couldn't make it, but I still felt some type of way."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fa3779c2-8ee2-4959-9da1-9882a7757a3b data-container-ref=toofab:article:6db28b1b-7abf-413e-a45e-e57686ac58c9 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/06/5by4/2023/09/22/0685fa7b27274c628a879f9e4737bf8f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty / MTV</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jersey Shore's Vinny Guadagnino Shares If He Believes Sammi & Ronnie's Returns Are Permanent (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>After both Mike and Angelina again considered the possibility that the girls lashed out because they were actually "upset with themselves," she said that's why she's "always in a fight" with Jenni and the other girls.</p><p>"That's exactly what happens," Angelina explained. "I point out what I see, and then they come for me. That's not fair anymore."</p><p>Meanwhile, in another hotel room, Jenni, Sammi, Deena, and <a href=#><strong>Vinny Guadagnino</strong></a> were waiting for their pals, believing Mike and Angelina were fighting for over an hour and a half.</p><p>The group made funny comparisons to express the amount of time that had passed.</p><p>"Wars have been fought quicker," Vinny said, whole Jenni joked, "Columbus got here faster. They created a vaccine faster. My marriage was shorter than this argument."</p><p>Watch the full clip, above, and see what happens next when the full episode drops tonight on MTV.</p><a id=gallery-link-39767cfc-9c85-41be-8ad5-cbfc6fd05efa class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:39767cfc-9c85-41be-8ad5-cbfc6fd05efa data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:6db28b1b-7abf-413e-a45e-e57686ac58c9 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3f/4by3/2023/08/03/3f03a652b4d8415696d4226b2056eec8_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma3Bfn7Kzv8SyZKygn6eybrLApqClsV2rrqSt06Kmp2WknbJuv8itrJqsmaS7brTUq6tmm5%2BowaK%2B0makoqujnruoecWapKKkqWKyt7HNrapmnaiYuba%2FyK%2BcZpucnr1w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./simple-nail-designs-230520-lift2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title></p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-spring-perfumes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 17 Best Spring Perfumes to Shop in 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
