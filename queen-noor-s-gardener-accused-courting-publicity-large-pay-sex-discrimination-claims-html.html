accusation, made under cross-examination while she testified to an employment tribunal.</span><br></p><p><span>The 51-year-old says she was bullied out of her job at the sprawling country estate after a male colleague was promoted and given many of her responsibilities.</span><br></p><p><span>Among her claims was that she had been ordered to plant avocados and mango trees at the Berkshire site.</span><br></p><p><span>When she pointed out that they would not grow in the English climate, she alleges estate manager Caroline Migdadi told her: 'Tell that to Her Majesty Queen Noor.'</span></p><p><span>Mrs Hill is suing Ambassador Marine Ltd, the Panama-based firm which technically owns and runs Buckhurst Park, near Ascot, for sexual discrimination and constructive dismissal.</span></p><p><span>Today, Schona Jolly, representing the firm, put to Mrs Hill: 'You used it (the sexual discrimination claim) as an attempt to effectively blackmail your previous employer
