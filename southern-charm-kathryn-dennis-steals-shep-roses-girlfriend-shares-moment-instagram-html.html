The social media influencer is also back to her iconic red locks.</p><p>Published on December 19, 2021</p><span></span><span>3 min read</span><p id=par-1_61>Kathryn Dennis is one of the OG cast members of <a href=#>Southern Charm</a>. Although the social media influencer wasn’t a full-time star in the first season, the drama she brought was felt throughout the season. As the show wrapped filming season 8 of the Bravo reality series, Dennis shared a photo with Shep Rose’s girlfriend claiming she had “stolen” her from him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kathryn-dennis-southern-charm.jpg><h2 id=h-the-instagram-photo-of-kathryn-dennis-and-taylor-ann-green>The Instagram photo of Kathryn Dennis and Taylor Ann Green</h2><p id=par-2_59>Rose has finally <a href=#>found himself in a serious relationship</a> with Taylor Ann Green. Throughout the history of Southern Charm, Rose hadn’t had a formal relationship and was seen as a womanizer on the show. Green is expected to be featured in the new season of the reality series and she seems to have also hit it off with Dennis.</p><p id=par-3_60>The cast of the Bravo show has reportedly finished filming season 8 of the series. Southern Charm had a prolonged hiatus as stars Austen Kroll and Craig Conover were <a href=#>featured on other shows like Winter House</a> and Summer House. It was on Sunday, Dec. 19 that Dennis shared a photo alongside Green puckering up and getting ready for a kiss.</p><p id=par-4_7>“Stole her from Shep,” the caption read.</p><p id=par-5_43>Dennis returned to her red locks and in the picture is seen holding Green’s face getting ready to kiss her. It’s not entirely clear if they were in the middle of filming their show or if it was just a gathering among friends.</p><h2>Fans react to Kathryn Dennis’ steamy post</h2><p id=par-6_43>It wasn’t long before fans of Dennis took to the comment section to share their reactions to the steamy post. Many of her followers noted that they liked seeing her again with red hair as she had been blonde over the past year.</p><p id=par-7_25>“You both look beautiful and yes not to give unsolicited advice but very few people can rock red hair like you do,” a fan replied.</p><p id=par-8_24>“Gahhh keep your hair like this!!!! You can pull it all off but this length and color is everything, you’re gorgeous!!” a follower added.</p><p id=par-9_24>“OMG what must be going thru Shep’s mind right now. I don’t think he could have ever imagined this. Wow!” an Instagram user noted.</p><p id=par-10_15>“The red hair is Kathryn. Southern Charm is Kathryn. Kathryn is queen,” another fan mentioned.</p><p id=par-11_10>“Love the red hair so much more,” another follower commented.</p><p id=par-12_10>“You both look mahvalous, simply mahvalous!” another Instagram user said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/southern-charm-kathryn-dennis-bravo.jpg><h2>Kathryn Dennis is single again</h2><p id=par-13_53>Up until recently, Dennis had been dating Chleb Ravenell and in July 2021, they both <a href=#>celebrated their one-year anniversary</a>. However, fans that visit Dennis’ Instagram profile will not be able to find any photos of her and Ravenell together. The <a href=#>couple split up in November 2021</a> as season 8 of the show filmed.</p><p id=par-14_24>“She broke up with him and they are no longer living together,” a source confirmed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a>. “There is no bad ill-will between them.”</p><p id=par-15_41>Although Dennis and Ravenell have not disclosed what led to their breakup, the insider alleged that he was not ready to commit to her. Dennis has two kids from her tumultuous relationship with Thomas Ravenel that was chronicled on Southern Charm.</p><p id=par-16_60>“Her future husband would have to be this amazing stepfather to her children and be someone who would make a serious commitment to her, and [Ravenell] just wasn’t that,” the source alleged. “They weren’t meant to be and even friends of hers picked up on it. She has so much love in her life as is with her little kiddos.”</p><p id=par-17_8>Southern Charm will return to Bravo in 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAsMHToZyrpl2YtaK%2BzGaimqyYp8avecOepaeho2LAtbHApapmq5iavW6%2BzqycrGWXnr%2BtstGinKecXai1or7ErGSmp52au7V5yKeqrZmXp66uesetpKVn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-facts-about-draculaura-monster-high.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Facts About Draculaura (Monster High)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./suits-cast-where-are-they-now-patrick-j-adams-meghan-markle-gabriel-macht-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where are the cast of Suits now?
