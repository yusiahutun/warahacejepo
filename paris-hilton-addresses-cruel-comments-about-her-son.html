I’ve worked hard to cultivate an environment that is all about love, respect, and acceptance, and I expect the same in return,” she wrote.</p><p>“If I don’t post my baby, people assume I’m not a great mother, and if I do post him, there are some people who are cruel and hateful. I’m a proud working mom and my baby is perfectly healthy, adorable, and angelic.</p><p>“I’ve dreamt of being a mom for as long as I can remember. Phoenix is my world and has been the biggest blessing of my life. Every day with him is a reminder of what truly matters. It’s hard to fathom that there are people in the world who would target such innocence.</p><p>“I hope that people can treat one another with more kindness and empathy,” Paris concluded.</p><p>The emotional words come after a <a href=#>TikTok</a> user posted a video of the mean comments asking “What is wrong with this world?”</p><p>In the comments, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> mom explained: “There are some sick people in this world.☹️My angel is perfectly healthy.
