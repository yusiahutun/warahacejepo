They appealed to his philanthropy by offering up their own, volunteering for his Six Degrees charity ahead of their own prom.</p><p>According to the charity organization Bacon founded, the students helped build 5,000 kits for those in need, which included more than $865,000 in products. The kits, featuring essentials for daily living as well as an offer for three months of counseling, will be distributed to four different organizations.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"When I first heard about this #BaconToPayson thing, I was like 'Wow, this is crazy.' But you were all just tireless, unrelenting in your desire to have me return," Bacon said on Saturday. "And you talked me into it!"</p><p>"I think it's great to see that kind of commitment to anything," he continued. "I also think that it's amazing the power that this movie has had to just kind of bring people together, and connect on the basic ideas there are behind the movie - you know, standing up to authority sometimes, and to being forgiving to people who are not exactly the same as you, and for standing up for your own freedoms and your right to express yourself, and for having compassion for other people."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b2c6a27d-5a25-4dc6-bfef-87daea395879 data-container-ref=toofab:article:94ba834b-7941-41bd-9a34-b19d76fa4e4a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/77/5by4/2022/09/23/7747e16f391e4acc960e338be1b04c86_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kevin Bacon Shares Secret to 35-Year Marriage With Kyra Sedgwick</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The Nebo School District's social page has been following the efforts of students to bring Bacon back to Payson High School for more than a year now. Now, after the events of Saturday, all of them can officially say they are just one degree away from Kevin Bacon.</p><p>You can check out the reaction just below from students and faculty when Bacon praised them for all their creative efforts, work on behalf of their community, and then dropped the bombshell on them that, "I'm gonna come."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>On Saturday, the actor continued his praise of the student body, telling them that they'd done something really special, showing their compassion for others "by turning what could be just a movie star coming back to get a pat on the back, into something really positive."</p><p>"Thank you so much especially for your commitment to giving back to your community and to the people you're sharing this planet with, and I'm thrilled that we're going to be working here together today," Bacon concluded his message before helping the students build those 5,000 kits.</p><p>The school also awarded Bacon an honorary diploma for his "timeless performance and forever inspiration left at Payson High School," with the actor quipping this was the only time he's ever seen his name on a diploma. He also scored a varsity jacket with "Footloose 1984" on the back.</p><p>After a successful work day on Saturday and prom that night, Bacon and the students have certainly earned the right to kick off their Sunday shoes and celebrate a lot of hard work and effort paid off.</p><p>See more moments from the memorable weekend below.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>After over a year of trying to get Kevin Bacon to revisit the iconic "Footloose" film location at Payson High School before its demolition, the actor showed up just in time for prom.</p><p>FULL GALLERY: <a href=#>https://t.co/0GZejS4vjv</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2yzeHQKhj8</a></p>— KUTV2news (@KUTV2News) <a href=#>April 20, 2024</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@KUTV2News</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>He's still got the moves! 😎 Kevin Bacon grooved with "Footloose" fans at Payson High School on Saturday (prom day!).</p><p>MORE: <a href=#>https://t.co/0GZejS4vjv</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YqV6UVU6ya</a></p>— KUTV2news (@KUTV2News) <a href=#>April 20, 2024</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@KUTV2News</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just like he promised, Kevin Bacon has visited the high school in Payson, Utah, where they filmed <a href=#>#Footloose</a></p><p>The film celebrated its 40th anniversary this year.<a href=#>#KevinBacon</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JSEaXX3cpF</a></p>— 𝙲𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚖𝚊 𝙱𝚞𝚛𝚜𝚝 (@CinemaBurst) <a href=#>April 20, 2024</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@CinemaBurst</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kevin Bacon returns to Payson to cut loose for charity as ‘Footloose’ hits 40 <a href=#>https://t.co/wqy4QcI9ML</a> via <a href=#>@GephardtDaily</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4FybrIXHrD</a></p>— SLCScanner (@SLCScanner) <a href=#>April 21, 2024</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@SLCScanner</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kevin Bacon just said goodbye to Payson.
