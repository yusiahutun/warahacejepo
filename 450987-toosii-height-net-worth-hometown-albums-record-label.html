Toosii is a famous <a href=#>American rapper </a>and singer whose studio album, <i>Poetic Pain</i>, was one of the biggest. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was born</a> on January 9, 2000, in Syracuse, New York. This means that he is 22 years old as of 2022.</p><p class=align-left>The rapper grew up with a single mother in upstate New York, and things were tough considering the violence in the neighbourhood. So, music was the best avenue to release his anger.</p><p class=align-left>Toosii relocated to Raleigh, North Carolina, when he was 13 years old, where he started to follow up his passion for music seriously. <a href=#>The rapper</a> started recording at 16 while playing high school <a href=#>football</a>. He played as slotback and quarterback at Rolesville High School. While playing for his high school team, Toosii used to wear the no.3 jersey.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f30530185d0da0e5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vanilla Ice's family: children, wife, baby mama, parents</span></p></a><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>Is Toosii a rapper or singer? His lyrical prowess has proven that he is both. The rapper started his music career while young, primarily out of passion, as he used rap as an escape.</p><p class=align-left>He created the stage name Toosii after his football teammates mentioned it as a joke in high school. Toosii was lucky enough to be discovered early by the South Coast Music Group and signed with the label in 2019.</p><p class=align-left>However, things were not smooth initially, as he was homeless for quite some time before getting his footing. Toosii got his big break in 2019 after releasing the track <i>Red Lights</i> which accumulated millions of streams.</p><p class=align-left>People loved his lyrics because they often focused on more intimate details of his personal life than standard rap fame. As a result, Toosii released another mixtape, <i>Who Dat </i>on April 30, 2019, followed by the 13-track <i>Platinum Heart </i>mixtape on February 7, 2020. And with such releases, Toosii went mainstream and became a household name in the music industry.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/80ee2c5350281083.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Charice Pempengco (Jake Zyrus): gender transition, partner, latest updates</span></p></a><h3>Toosii’s discography</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3263a0240f7e23c3.jpg><p class=align-left>Toosii had a great start in his career, which he has been gradually building over the years with unforgettable songs, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">including studio albums</a>, mixtapes, and singles.
