All signs point to spring, which is why it’s time to discuss <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>how Aries season 2024 will affect each zodiac sign</a>. Taking place at the moment of the spring equinox, this is more than a seasonal shift—it’s the astrological new year.</p><p>Because Aries is the first sign in the zodiac wheel, it always wipes the slate clean and empowers you to embrace new beginnings. Who cares if you broke your New Year’s resolutions back in January? Everyone knows <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the real “new year”</a> takes place when the sun enters Aries on March 19 at exactly 11:06 p.m. ET. Prepare to feel harder, better, faster, and stronger, because this season is jam-packed with chaos and change this year.</p><p>Aries is a zodiac sign that craves immediate results, but as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Venus-Saturn conjunction in Pisces</a> arrives on March 21, you may be forced to slow-down, especially in your relationships. This conjunction could create delays and frustrations in love, but it’s ultimately asking you to be practical and committed with your heart. Instant gratification rarely ever produces the desired result.</p><p>This year, Aries season may feel dreamy, restless, and somewhat bewildering. After all, Mars—Aries’ ruling planet—enters Pisces on March 22, tempering your concern with ego and your desire for action. Mars is the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">planet of drive and aggression</a>, and Pisces contains an ocean of emotion right below the surface. Will you get swept up in its currents or can you paddle your way to shore?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-30.png><p>The intensity of Aries season reaches a boiling point on March 25, when a full moon (and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">penumbral lunar eclipse</a>) rises at 5 degrees of Libra. This eclipse will join forces with the South Node of Karma, and in astrology, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the South Node</a> represents everything you are letting go of and outgrowing. This eclipse may kickstart the process of shedding your skin and creating space for something new, especially in your relationships. And because eclipses evoke major life changes, you may be letting go of something for good.</p><p>However, these changes may be confusing to process at first, because on April 1, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mercury stations retrograde</a> at 27 degrees Aries. This year, April Fool’s Day is taking on a whole new meaning, so expect the pranks and hijinks to be next level. This retrograde could intensify your desire to take action, but anger and impulsivity could cause you to major mistakes that could have been avoided. Think twice before you act, especially when Mercury is moving backwards. Because Mercury retrograde tends to increase confusion and resurrect unfinished business, you may not be sure which changes are permanent and which are temporary just yet.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The sun enters Aries on March at 11:06 p.m. ET and leaves it behind on April 19 at 10 a.m. ET.</p></figure><p>Prepare for an explosion of magic and romance by April 3, when Venus joins forces with mystical and empathetic Neptune. Because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Venus will be in Pisces</a>—the zodiac sign of its exaltation—this is a beautiful moment to tell someone you love them, take someone out on a date, or even reunite with a past lover. The energy is perfect for a love that feels out-of-this-world and too good to be true, but remember—feelings are not facts.</p><p>Take advantage of this whimsy, as love is bound to get more complicated when Venus enters Aries on April 5. Because Venus is in “detriment” when moving through Aries, it will increase the odds of self-oriented behavior, such as ghosting during conversations, coming on too strong, and pursuing someone that isn’t receptive to you. However, it’s also a beautiful time to indulge in self-love and take dating a lot less seriously, especially because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mercury will be retrograde</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-29.png><p>The most climactic moment of this season arrives on April 8, when a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">total solar eclipse takes place</a> at exactly 19 degrees Aries. This eclipse could evoke cataclysmic changes that are ultimately healing for your identity and your overall sense of independence. Chiron will also be sitting at exactly 19 degrees Aries, causing this eclipse to trigger your deepest wounds and show you how far you’ve come. This eclipse can be thought of as a “teaching moment,” as you will be remembering your own pain and showing others how to navigate theirs. By being vulnerable and true to yourself, you are already helping the world become a better place. Because the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">North Node of Destiny</a> is currently moving through Aries, this eclipse will push you toward a future that was always meant to be yours. Trust in the process.</p><p>These eclipses could rearrange your entire life and kickstart massive transformations, but things may not be moving as fast as you’d like them to. After all, Mars will form a conjunction with Saturn—planet of discipline, restriction, and delayed gratification—which could leave you feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place. Let’s not forget that Mars and Saturn are the most difficult planets of astrology, throwing obstacles in your path and testing your limits. You may want to charge ahead, but this year, Aries season is also about slowing down and forming a game-plan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-aries-season-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign>How Aries Season Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Are you ready for this powerful season to begin?

By the time Aries season is over, certain aspects of your identity and your relationships could look very different. The sun may be charging through Aries, where it is both exalted and empowering as it energizes your first house of the self. However, as a Venus-Saturn conjunction unfolds in your lonely 12th house on March 21, the season may start off sluggish, emotional, and filled with solitude.</p><p>Regardless of this season’s slow pacing, you’re geared for major changes as the month progresses. On March 25, a lunar eclipse in Libra could cause you to let go of a relationship that you’ve outgrown. It could also force you to recognize what needs healing in your relationships. However, as Mercury stations retrograde in Aries on April 1, you may feel more confused about what you feel and how to act, giving you time to rethink your motivations. By the time a total solar eclipse arrives on April 8, you may feel like your life has been struck by lightning; as though something is happening that is very much out of your control.

As the Aries sun moves through your 12th house of spirituality and self-undoing, you may find yourself looking inward and indulging in well-deserved solitude. You may even be rethinking who you spend time with and who you associate with, as Venus—your ruling planet—is joining forces with Saturn in your 11th house of community on March 21.</p><p>You can expect breakthroughs in therapy and changes in your routine to unfold as Aries season progresses. A lunar eclipse lands in your sixth house of work, health, and regimens on March 25, revealing the status of your physical wellness and allowing you to let go of unhealthy habits. However, as Mercury stations retrograde in your introspective 12th house on April 1, you may dive even deeper into your healing process, forcing you to tie off loose ends in your heart and mind.

This is helping you tap into your network and reach people on the fringe, emphasizing the power of your acquaintances. However, as Venus joins forces with Saturn in your 10th house of publicity and authority on March 21, you may feel unsure of your accomplishments, but equally as inspired to lay down the groundwork for long-term career growth. Luckily, Mars activates your public-facing 10th house as of March 22, increasing your stamina as the weeks progress.</p><p>A lunar eclipse in Libra sparks a transformation in your ninth house of wisdom and discovery on March 25, which could inspire you to travel, return to school, or become someone’s mentor. It could launch a brand new experience that allows you to let go of outdated perspectives.
