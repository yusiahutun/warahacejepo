The confession intially came during a sit-down interview Sunday with <a href=#><strong>Piers Morgan.</strong></a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>EXCLUSIVE: In <a href=#>@piersmorgan</a>'s Life Stories, Mel B revealed she slept with bandmate Geri Horner in the mid-nineties. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PQoAXlt9uE</a></p><a href=# rel=noopener>@GMB</a><p>Mel went on to clarify her comments while appearing on <a href=#><strong>2Day FM</strong></a> radio show Monday and reiterated that her little tryst with Halliwell wasn't a "big deal."</p><p>"It was just one of those things that happened one night and I didn't go into detail about it at all," Mel said. "I just said it was a little thing and we giggled about it the next day and that's that.</p><p>The singer also spoke about the conversation she had with Halliwell following her interview with Morgan. "I just texted her and I said, 'Look I admitted on Piers that we had a little bit of a thing but don't worry about it. It was all tongue-in-cheek and I didn't go into detail.' I said 'So don't worry about it'...I don't know why everyone is making such a big deal about it."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f61f8eb1-f957-5b6d-9bb6-2088bcbdf7fb data-container-ref=toofab:article:ac5d6a12-b6df-5ba0-acf8-be5ba0cb21e0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c1/5by4/2019/02/28/c1cf94c37a83515985a674605f567012_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">TBS</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">La La Anthony Destroys Mel B in Epic 'Drop the Mic' Battle -- 'You Were Nothing More Than Victoria's Assistant'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>When asked if Halliwell responded back to her, Mel said, "Yeah. We had a long conversation. She texted me the night of and then we just spoke at lunch today amongst other things because we're getting ready for tour right now."</p><p>During her confession Sunday night, after admitting to the rumors, Mel laughed and said, "She's going to kill me and so's her husband."</p><p>But, Mel insisted, it was just a one-time encounter. "She's going to hate me for this because she's all posh in her country house and her husband. But it's a fact. It just happened and we just giggled at it and that was it." She also noted with a smile, "She had great boobs."</p><p>"And hopefully when Geri gets asked that, which hopefully she will after this, she won't deny it," Mel said. "Because it was just a fun thing."</p><p>When Morgan tried to dig in and ask how many times they'd been together, Mel shut him down hard. "Stop it, you pervert!" she said. "We were best friends. It just happened. Have you ever done that?"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:69668f7c-c404-508d-a854-45ab83c54910 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ac5d6a12-b6df-5ba0-acf8-be5ba0cb21e0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0f/5by4/2018/11/27/0f6e4c6caf365ddabcdc332c70e77dfa_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">6 'Brutally Honest' Bombshells from Mel B's Memoir: Threesomes, Suicide Attempt, Drug Abuse and More</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She also admitted to some intimacy with the other girls, but it was far more innocent and playful in comparison. "When I got my tongue pierced we all kissed. But that was just a kiss because I wanted to know what it felt like. It was just a silly kiss. Nothing sexual like that."</p><p>At the end of the conversation, Mel seemed to fully grasp what she'd just confessed to after so many years of staying silent. "I have said it now. All done," she acknowledged. "She's going to kill me."</p><p>According to Mel today, it seems that everything is good between the two. We hope it won't impact their relationship, as the group is preparing for their upcoming reunion tour in a couple of weeks, as Mel pointed out. Especially considering Halliwell notoriously left the group in 1998 amid rumors it was due to clashes with Mel B.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
