The designer, who has dressed entertainer and supermodel Tyra Banks, was born into a highly respected political family and was expected to enter the political arena. But he had other plans mapped out and his love of theatre inspired him to pursue a career in fashion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The motivating factor that pushed me towards becoming a fashion designer was the power of transformation and [the ability that clothes have] to empower people. It is magical that by creating beautiful clothes, you actually create a persona and strengthen a person’s character,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/05/2f9bab7e-0c31-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_972x_050236.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think of myself as a creator of modern-day armour. This is what gives me a lot of pleasure and purpose in designing. It’s all about making sure that people feel and look better in your designs.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One particular quality Filipino designers are hugely admired for is their resilience despite the many hurdles they face. “Our industry doesn’t have any real support system,” Laurel says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We don’t have any support from the government, or even a fabric industry to speak of. We don’t even have the basic necessary tools to make our work what it is, in a sense. So we have to be resilient, and we have to be extra creative and resourceful. These&nbsp;qualities make us unique. We can create [beautiful pieces] from almost [nothing].”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Laurel’s view, today’s global fashion industry has become more receptive to Filipino fashion, which has gained considerably in popularity in the past decade or so.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">He was very aggressive in showing the world what Filipino fashion isRajo Laurel</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s something that’s visible everywhere. And it feels really great to see our little islands represented in this global setting. Nowadays. we’re always [invited] to showcase our designs at major fashion weeks” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So things have definitely changed and are getting better day by day. Going to these big fashion shows allows us all to bring our craftsmanship to the attention of the industry people who want to see what we have to offer, and on what scale.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Why Alber Elbaz is happily in the spotlight with Tod’s collaboration</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tee, who has shown her collections at several New York fashion Week showcases, says the first Filipino fashion designer to prosper at an international level was US-based Josie Natori, founder and CEO of The Natori Company.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She gave us an international platform to build on when she succeeded in creating a stir with her brand in New York,” Tee says. “She truly is a fashion icon when it comes to encouraging young women to pursue the same path.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/05/34326b1e-0c31-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_972x_050236.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Laurel, on the other hand, considers the late Pitoy Moreno to be the godfather of Filipino fashion, in terms of making it extremely popular long before new names like Natori and Lhuillier emerged.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He was very aggressive in showing the world what Filipino fashion is. He would go around the globe and showcase it through various establishments and avenues,” Laurel says. “This was from the early 50s to the mid 60s. I think he was probably the first to reach the international stage in terms of spreading awareness of the beauty of Filipino fashion.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tee takes pride in the fact that Filipino fashion designers are now slowly easing their way into the major fashion weeks of the four fashion capitals, and that it’s becoming easier for them to participate and trade on a global level. “This exposure has allowed us to envision a reality where our brands can be seen and appreciated by an international audience,” she says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How red carpet fashion designer Zac Posen lost his label</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asked how Filipino designers’ strategies differ from those of their Western and other Asian counterparts, she replies, “Filipino designers have a predilection for evening wear, and they abide strictly by haute couture traditions. Unlike our Eastern and Western counterparts, who are more into fast fashion, we’re more attuned to slow fashion. We are more into the production of investment-worthy pieces.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When it comes to comparing the Filipino fashion industry to those of other Asian countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and India, Laurel says, “I think our colleagues from these countries are more advanced in the area of representation because they’ve got what it takes to make it. However, we’re not that far behind – we also give our best.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/05/3668c3b0-0c31-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_1320x770_050236.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Laurel, designers draw up their strategies keeping in mind what they want their brand to be. At the end of the day, it is all about doing business in a productive way where both parties – the designers and clients – are happy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“While [design] is your intuitive passion, you can’t overlook your demographics,” Laurel says. “You design your collections according to your demographic. My clients are mainly women in their twenties and fifties. I have the House of Laurel and Rajo! to cater to [the two different groups of clients].”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">6 Chinese fashion designers with global appeal</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like Laurel, Tee feels that Filipinos have something invaluable to offer the fashion industry – a taste for the finer details. “We have a love of intricate beading. There are both Eastern and Western influences in the way our culture views fashion, and so we understand how to blend these two influences flawlessly with designs that are local and international at the same time,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In this digital age, it is important to remain connected to your devices to stay in touch with your clients. “My clients are tech-savvy. Technology is one of the clearest and most efficient ways to get through to my market. With a smartphone in hand, we can find out what they’re looking for. And we’re constantly there, and we want to make our presence felt through these particular channels,” Laurel says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/05/0050aa44-11a5-11ea-82cd-148dc44829b8_972x_050236.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Similarly, Tee achieved global fame as a fashion designer because she had the opportunity to take part in two major events: Mercedes-Benz STYLO Asia Fashion Week and New York Fashion Week. As it happened, she reached a platform where she was able to share her designs with the international marketplace.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“By really being aggressive in sharing my work on the digital space, I quickly brought my brand closer to people from different countries. And it’s rewarding to know that they’ve shown appreciation for my work,” Tee says. “I believe that my success is due partly to the strong online presence of my work. But this was never on the cards as an intentional marketing strategy.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Laurel believes there is a great deal of passion for Filipino designers’ work among Chinese audiences and he dismisses any idea of prejudice linked directly to the issue of domestic helpers in Hong Kong.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Legendary fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld dies at 85</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That has no impact on matters that demonstrate the artistic mindset of Filipinos at all. Besides, the clients that I serve belong to different areas of the region and they’re more interested in the product than anything else,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tee agrees that Chinese audiences have often been in love with the attire created by Filipino designers. “I don’t feel any outright prejudice from my Chinese audience because I believe my work has been able to justify itself without it being racially profiled,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m a second-generation Chinese-born Filipino who was raised in the Philippines, and perhaps my own cultural ties and natural preference for merging these two pillars of heritage help in identifying my work as not solely of Philippines design. In essence, it’s neutral.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/05/0b290340-0c31-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_972x_050236.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tee’s target demographic typically ranges between late teens and early sixties, and is basically at its strongest within the thirties bracket because of the typical formal events that women of that age attend in their spectacular glamour. The millennial audience matters a lot to her, too. “I’m of the millennial age group, so I would like to think that their reception of our work has been very positive,” she adds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Laurel is similarly full of praise for the millennial audience, saying they are more forward-looking when it comes to how they dress up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Each generation is very interesting and I would like to learn more about the way they consume, and the way they look at fashion, and I think it’s always important to keep myself up-to-date with the times and so I’m learning and I like the fact that I’m very open to the ideas they have,” he says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How Dior, Prada and other brands are bringing 60s fashion back</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Laurel is busy expanding his brand locally to reach a wider demographic, he wants to be in control. “I simply don’t want to grow in the sense that I will burn out, with no energy left to pick up the pieces again. That’s why I want to continue at a pace where I feel like I’m enjoying what I’m doing and taking one step at a time to keep things in order,” he explains.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“One of the many things I’m looking forward to doing later this year is designing the uniforms for the&nbsp;Southeast Asian Games,&nbsp;so that’s an exciting project I’m deeply involved with at the moment.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/05/0913af24-0c31-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_972x_050236.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tee says her love of fashion comes from her family who have always enjoyed the art of dressing up. “In Filipino society, there are lots of great occasions when they have to get ready to look at their best. This led me to develop an appreciation for the design and production processes of garments, and eventually piqued my interest in pursuing a career in the industry,” she says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">6 Jun Ji-hyun looks that made her a fashion icon</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Looking at trends as a whole, Tee always tries to infuse her own take on what is occurring around the world in terms of style and fashion. “I wouldn’t say that when trends occur I make it a point to interpret it in a way that my clients and I can appreciate together. That’s not my style.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As her brand becomes more popular, she wants to ensure that new things are always included. “I intend to expand my line of custom bridal and evening wear on an international scale with a ready-to-wear line specialising in that aspect as well,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In retrospect, Tee does have one important point to make as to how her brand stands apart from the rest, which she deftly clarifies by explaining, “My brand is a contemporary interpretation of subtle elegance with an appreciation for a good fit and a fine balance of embellishment. The Rosenthal Tee woman definitely exudes a strong feminine vibe and is unafraid to be who she really is.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
