Locs can be cut, curled, and, yes, even dyed. However, since the hair isn't loose, you'll need to know how to dye locs because you switch up your color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For instance, you'll want to think about what shade you want, whether you want to dye your full head of locs, stick with highlights, or opt for an ombré finish. You'll also want to be&nbsp;very&nbsp;specific about who you go to for your dye job because not every hairstylist or colorist is trained to work with locs — even if they're curly hair connoisseurs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, we spoke with hair artist and loc expert&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Lord</a>&nbsp;— who has had blonde locs herself — to learn more about the dyeing process. She also shared a few other helpful tips below.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Lord</a> is a hair artist, loc expert, and natural hair educator.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-know-before-dyeing-your-locs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Know Before Dyeing Your Locs</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You'll need to ensure your locs are healthy and free of any damage by doing a self-assessment, but you should have a loc expert examine your hair as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Lord,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>damaged dreadlocks</a>&nbsp;are normal and can be caused by medications, an unbalanced diet, stress, and even genetics. For reference, damaged locs might be broken or matted, have broken hairs at the base, or be thinning at the edges.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your locs are fine and you decide to go for the new color, don't be afraid to research and ask questions before you take the plunge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Inquire about the ingredients in the color to ensure you're not allergic to anything, and make sure you don't irritate your scalp prior to color application," Lord advised.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Also, during the consultation, ask for a strand test on one of your locs to make sure it's the color you're looking to achieve and that you don't have a negative reaction to the product," added Lord.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lord noted that if this isn't your first rodeo with hair color, you should be careful not to over-process the hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One should avoid dyeing locs if they have done color within the last six to eight weeks," she said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-salon-vs-diy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Salon vs. DIY</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Lord, unless you're a loc expert, it's best to leave this type of job to professionals to avoid potential hair damage. "Locs coloring requires a level of expertise that is gained through years of experience," she explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of the dyes themselves, Lord is a fan of both <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Naturtint</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Herbatint</a>. "They are mostly plant-based and have no ammonia," she explained. "While [they] still have a chemical for lifting, it's much milder than other coloring systems." However, once you visit your stylist, they can assess your hair and decide which dye is best suited for you.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-you-may-not-want-to-see-a-general-colorist></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why You May Not Want to See a General Colorist</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unless they specialize in loc care, it's better to be safe than sorry. "I&nbsp;highly&nbsp;recommend going to a professional loctician and colorist with years of loc coloring experience," Lord said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since the hair strands aren't loose, special steps need to be taken to ensure the dye is properly applied and rinsed out. Also, depending on where you are in your loc journey, you may or may not be able to use certain treatment or conditioning products after your hair has been dyed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So yeah, leave it to the people who have years of experience dealing with and dyeing locs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: 6 Twisted Hairstyle Ideas for Anyone with Natural Hair</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-keeping-locs-healthy-after-a-color-treatment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Keeping Locs Healthy After a Color Treatment</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Lord, when it comes to locs, doing less is more. It's fine to stick with your regular wash day and maintenance routine unless your loctician suggests otherwise. "However, essential oils are good for adding shine to your color and a healthy, vibrant look and feel," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>All Natural</a>.&nbsp;From the kinkiest coils to loose waves, we're celebrating natural hair in its many forms by sharing expert tips for styling, maintenance, and hair care.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eRobluusCtrKuZnGS1sMOMraZmm5%2BhvLN5y6iarA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lollapalooza-in-2002.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lollapalooza In 2002?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./depeche-mode-launches-first-digital-download-concert-ticket-pre-sale.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Depeche Mode Launches First Digital Download Concert Ticket Pre-sale</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
