Also, Caldwell ascended the West Buttress, Dawn Wall, and Triple Crown of El Captain in Yosemite National Park. Tommy moved&nbsp;to Longs Peak, Colorado early in his career, climbing The Honeymoon is Over V, a rating of 5.13.</p><p>In the non-fiction work Over the Edge: The True Story of Four American Climbers’ Kidnap and Escape in the Central Asian Mountains, Caldwell’s traumatic experience is recounted. Tommy married twice in his life and he shares two children with wife <strong>Rebecca Pietsch</strong>.</p><h2>A native of Estes Park, Colorado</h2><p>Tommy Caldwell was born on August 24, 1978, in Estes Park, Colorado, the United States of America.

The family even went on annual trips to Yosemite National Park where Candwell’s love for the park and rock climbing flourished.</p><h2>Loss of a Finger</h2><p>In 2001, Tommy’s left index finger accidentally sawed-off much with a table saw. Doctors were able to repair the severed section. However, Caldwell decided that he did not want the useless finger with which doctors said he would never be able to climb again, and that the injured part of the finger was subsequently permanently removed.</p><h2>Rock Climbing Career</h2><p>Caldwell first ascents of some of the US hardest sports routes including sport routes including Kryptonite(5.15a) at the Fortress of Solitude, Colorado.&nbsp; Likewise, he finished the first free ascent(FFA) od Dihedral Wall in May 2004.

The estimated net worth of Tommy is <strong>$1.5 million</strong> as of 2019.

Although the climber has amassed a pretty good amount, he is yet to share the details about his house and cars. Since he is still active in the field, we are sure that his net worth is expected to grow.</p><h2>Married to Rebecca Pietsch</h2><p>6 feet 4-inch tall rock climber is happily living with wife<strong> Rebecca Pietsch</strong> whom he married in 2012. The love birds met back in 2010 and were in a relationship for more than two years before they tied the knot.
