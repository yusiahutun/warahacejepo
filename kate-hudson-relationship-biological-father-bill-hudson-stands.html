"It's warming up."</p><p>"There's warming up with this all happening. But it'll be whatever it will be, you know," she continued. "I have -- I have no expectation of that with my father, you know. I just want him to be happy."</p><p>Discussing her upcoming album, Glorious, Hudson likened some of her singing talent to that of her father, who was a member of the '70s rock band, The Hudson Brothers.</p><p>"Those Hudson Brothers are crazy talented musicians and wonderful songwriter. My dad's a great songwriter," Hudson gushed.</p><p>While Bill is her biological father, he and Kate's mother, <a href=#><strong>Goldie Hawn</strong></a>, split in 1980, when the film and television star was just 18-months old. Hudson was raised in large part by her mother's longtime partner, <a href=#><strong>Kurt Russell</strong></a>, who came into Kate's life two years later in 1982.</p><p>Both Kate and her older brother, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Oliver Hudson</strong></a>, have been open about trying to work things out with their father, and most recently, their estranged siblings.</p><p>On a January episode of their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sibling Revelry</strong></a> podcast, the two were speaking with Good Charlotte's Benji and Joel Madden when one of the rockers shared how they believed siblings "gotta salvage what you can" even when coming from a broken home.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1c1398d0-3248-4518-b6bd-07b47b89fffa data-container-ref=toofab:article:ff0d531e-5fef-461a-930f-f32cfe82f352 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e0/5by4/2024/01/17/e07ea391322f4ec99fce6d627304de29_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kate Hudson Details Emotional Phone Call with Estranged Siblings</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It doesn't always have to feel broken," they said, before the Academy Award nominee shared she was currently working on mending things with her siblings.</p><p>"I had this moment last year where I was like, 'I don't know why I don't talk to my other siblings.' I don't care what the history is with our parents, but like -- and especially me who has no sisters, right? And I do," she said. "I have two sisters that I don't speak to for no other reason except that our family separated."</p><p>"My sister and I and my brother, we've all just started communicating again," she continued. "And honestly, I got on the phone with my sister and we just started bawling our eyes out. It was so great. It was so great."</p><p>"She even said it, 'We start now. Just start now,'" Kate added.</p><a id=gallery-link-ca3a2da3-cef6-4e51-9236-63ca4a2a099f class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ca3a2da3-cef6-4e51-9236-63ca4a2a099f data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:ff0d531e-5fef-461a-930f-f32cfe82f352 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/85/4by3/2024/04/29/8545cd52c21d4f31857ae3ef255516ca_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma3FfoK61sYyhrJ2rn6N6s7HLmquip56otaq8jJugqKSfnLakrctmnZqsmJq%2Fbq7IpaNmoKWZwLC6jKyrmqaUqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./live-nation-announces-initial-silver-spring-fillmore-team.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Live Nation Announces Initial Silver Spring Fillmore Team</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-think-you-should-leave-with-tim-robinson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
