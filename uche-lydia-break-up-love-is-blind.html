Uche revealed in Episode 3 that he and Lydia, who got engaged to Milton, dated before Love Is Blind Season 5 started filming. The reveal came during a conversation between Uche and Aaliyah, his top choice and Lydia’s best friend in The Pods. “I haven’t been completely honest with you. One of my dates on the first day, I walked into The Pods, and I started talking. The person seemed to recognize my voice and know certain things about me. It is a girl that I have dated in the past,” Uche said. “It’s Lydia.”&nbsp;</p><p>In Episode 4, Love Is Blind showed a flashback of Uche and Lydia’s conversation, in which Lydia recognized Uche based on his voice. “My name is Uche,” Uche says, to which Lydia responds, “Fuck!” Uche then laughs and say, “That’s not the reaction I was expecting.” Lydia then tells Uche things about himself. “Your name is Uche Okoroha.&nbsp; You’re a lawyer, have a business.” When Uche doesn’t recognize Lydia’s voice, Lydia tells him that he knows her from outside of The Pods. When Uche figures out that it’s Lydia, Lydia asks him if he should take them both being on Love Is Blind Season 5 as a sign for them to get back together. “Is this a sign that we should cut the crap and start at zero? A blessing in disguise?” Lydia says, to which Uche doesn’t agree. “I don’t think we should do that because it ruins the experiment.” Lydia then asks, “So you don’t think it’s worth it to get to know each other more?” Uche responds, “I don’t think it’s genuine to the experience because we already know each other.”&nbsp;</p><p>In his conversation with Aaliyah, Uche explained that he and Lydia dated for a few months but he broke up with her because he didn’t think they were a right fit. “I didn’t think we were that compatible, so I ended things. It hurt me so much,” he said. “It hurt me so much because she deserves an amazing person who is completely sure about her, and I really hope she finds that.” Lydia leaves The Pods to take a second to collect herself. When she returns, she tells Uche about how Lydia made odd comments about Uche before Aaliyah learned they dated. “She’s been making comments. She’s been saying things, and I’m like, ‘How do you know this?’ Even when we had our disagreement, she was the first person to come console me and encourage me and told me that, ‘If he doesn’t make this right, it’s on him.’ She just kept saying all the right things. She’s told me multiple times, ‘I just see myself in you. We are almost the same woman.’ It’s just weird.”&nbsp;</p><p>When Aaliyah tells Lydia about what Uche told her, Lydia explained that Uche broke up with her because she had become dependent on him as one of the few people she knew in Houston. “Uche met me when I was at a low point in my life. He was vulnerable with me. I was vulnerable with him. I do feel like when we met and we were dating, he just felt that we would have had to take up too much. Like, ‘Shit, she barely has friends here. She doesn’t have family here. I’ll have to be everything for her.’ I didn’t want to lose him. It was I guess not meant to be,” Lydia said.&nbsp;</p><p>Lydia also confirmed that she wanted to continue being friends with Aaliyah and that she doesn’t still have feelings for Uche. Aaliyah became iffy about Lydia when she continued to tell Aaliyah information about Uche’s life&nbsp; without her asking, such as details about his dog, his friends, his job, his house, and his car. Lydia also revealed to Aaliyah that she and Uche last saw each other three months ago before Love Is Blind Season 5 started filming, and they had sex. “You had sex three months ago, and I’m supposed to feel like that’s no big deal? I don’t like that. I would never put myself in a situation like this in my actual life,” Aaliyah said in a confessional interview. At the end of Episode 4, a producer tells Uche that Aaliyah had decided to leave the show, ending their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>So where are Lydia, Uche, and Aaliyah from Love Is Blind Season 5 now? At the time Love Is Blind Season 5 premiered, Lydia and Uche were not following each other on Instagram. Aaliyah and Uche also were not following each other. Lydia and Aaliyah also were not following each other, which suggests that they’re not still friends after their drama with Uche.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">E! News</a> in September 2023, Aaliyah confirmed that she and Uche were not still together after Love Is Blind Season 5. “Making the decision to leave, I felt like it was the best thing for me. It was really hard because I had a lot of love for him,” she said. “At the moment, I was like, ‘Man, I just don’t feel like this is the type of situation that I would want going into an engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Lydia told E! News that she was “shocked” when she learned that Uche and Lydia dated before Love Is Blind Season 5. “I was very shocked. I just felt it was super hard for me to process everything. I had fallen in love so fast. I was all in, and there’s a lot of room to be like, ‘Man, I don’t know about this.’ But it wasn’t just the reveal of their past, it was conversations that I had had with Uche,” she said. “Like any other dating situation, you learn things about them and people put their best feet forward in the beginning, and then the flaws start to come to the surface on both sides, and you’re like, ‘I don’t know about this.’ So that’s where I was, even before the reveal of knowing they had a past.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite everything, Aaliyah told E! News that she didn’t regret her time on Love Is Blind Season 5. “I was super nervous at first, and as I got more used to being in the setting, it was really exhilarating and refreshing to be in there, seeking out love and trying to find a partner in that way was so cool. It’s just different. It’s unique,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Aaliyah told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in September 2023 that she’s now realized that Uche keeping his past with Lydia with a secret was a “red flag.” “I think all of us have a past [and] history going into relationships after a certain point in life,” she said. “We all have things that we’re going to have to work through with a new partner [that’s] not necessarily bringing in a bunch of baggage, but your lessons learned even some traumas and different things that you’re going to have to work through.”</p><p>She continued, “I know with marriage, you’re navigating a lot. You’re going to have to compromise and work through things. I was open to [discussing the hard truths].” Aaliyah also explained why she left Love Is Blind Season 5 early. “It was really just the emotional security that was really lacking for me going into the engagement,” she said.</p><p>Chris Coelen, the executive producer of Love Is Blind Season 5, confirmed to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a> in September 2023 that the producers of the show didn’t know Uche and Lydia were exes until filming started. “we do a very thorough vetting process across all kinds of criteria. We really go to some great lengths, and to the best of our ability, we try to ensure that the pool of people in the pods don’t know each other. Obviously, we’re not infallible, and this one happened. However it happened, it happened, and we had to deal with the ramifications of it,” he said.</p><p>He continued, “We had absolutely no idea. The intention is that we have a pool of people that don’t know each other, We have had a few instances in the past with people on the same side, like it’s two women who know each other a little bit, but we haven’t had people, to my knowledge, on the other side of the pod that knew each other, and we’ve never had, to my knowledge, people who have had a relationship in the past. It’s just mind-blowing that that was the case, and truly shocking on day one that that information was delivered to me.”</p><p>Coelen also explained what happened behind-the-scenes when Uche and Lydia learned that they were both on Love Is Blind Season 5. “I was sitting in the control room on day one of dating. I think we have 89 cameras in the pods and there’s lots of stuff happening,” he said. “We have a big team of hundreds of crew members, and there’s always somebody listening to something. Whoever was listening in to Uche and Lydia’s conversation, as soon as that date was coming to an end, they came over and said, ‘These two people know each other. They had this relationship [previously].'”</p><p>He continued, “We immediately stopped them, pulled them aside, prevented them from going back into the mix in the pods, and brought them to separate interview rooms. We said to them first, ‘I don’t know how this happened, this is awful. I know you’ve planned to be here and you’ve gone through this whole process, and now you know each other. I don’t know how we can continue with you in this experiment, and I know that sucks.'”</p><p>Coelen also confirmed that Uche and Lydia both told producers that they didn’t want to get back together after finding out they were both in The Pods.. “They’re like, ‘You mean you’re going to send us home?’ We said, ‘I don’t know how you can continue,’ and they’re like, ‘We want to continue,'” he said. “Again, these are separate conversations, but basically, they’re saying the same thing: ‘We want to continue and we want to be here, and we’re really serious.’ Each of them said, ‘We have no interest in dating the other one.’ Both of them spoke very glowingly of the other. Both of them said, ‘It was kind of on-and-off but no interest moving forward. We really want to find somebody that’s committed to this.'”</p><p>He continued, “So we said, ‘If we were to allow you to continue being part of this experiment, knowing that you are really passionate about being here, we will allow you to continue under one condition.’ We never police what anybody says, but in this case, it was the only time where we’ve said, ‘We would like if you would not reveal this to the others.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfqrCpsYylsJ2hkWKvs7HApGSuqF2hvLexjKKqZpqcnrulew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kimberly-drive-standoff-ends-with-tear-gas-41-year-old-s-arrest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kimberly Drive standoff ends with tear gas, 41-year-olds arrest | Free News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tony-rock-wife-girlfriend-dating-net-worth-family-siblings-height-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Tony Rock?
