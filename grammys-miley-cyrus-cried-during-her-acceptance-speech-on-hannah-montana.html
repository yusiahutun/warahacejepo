The <a href=#>celebrity</a> won the first of her Grammys for her song Flowers in the category Record of the Year. She also won another gong for Best Pop Solo Performance. <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>‘ Grammys speech was full of laughter, smiles and gratitude, but fans probably didn’t know she already planned one in an iconic scene from Hannah Montana.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miley-cyrus-technically-had-a-grammys-speech-planned-years-ago>Miley Cyrus technically had a Grammys speech planned years ago</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1978657916-1024x683.jpg><p>Although it was written in a fictional <a href=#>TV</a> show, Miley Cyrus dreamed of winning a Grammy more than once during her 20-year career in the music industry.</p><p>And in one such scene, she writes a pre-planned <a href=#>Grammys</a>‘ speech where she pretends to break down and cry. Luckily, Miley didn’t do this on the night at the prestigious <a href=#>awards show</a> over the weekend. But her <a href=#>admittance of not wearing underwear</a> may have had fans in tears of laughter!</p><p>In the scene, which is like an eerie prediction, she talks about being alongside other great artists in the music realm. Whereas, in her acceptance speech for Pop Solo Performance, Miley Cyrus fangirled over <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> being the one to hand over one of her Grammys.</p><p>Pretty on the nose.</p><p>In the clip, Miley (Hannah) writes down: “Thank you, Grammy voters for Record of the Year, I can’t believe it, I had nothing prepared.”</p><p>“Oh yeah, I can cry like that,” as she snaps her fingers.</p><p>“Lady Gaga, <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>, I can’t even believe I’m in the same category as you-boo-hoo-hoo”, starting to fake cry after standing up.</p><p>It may just be a TV scene, but the celebrity has admitted in the past it wasn’t always fictional.</p><p>She said: “Really, Hannah Montana was not a character. The concept of the show, it’s me. I’ve really had to come to terms with that and not be third-person about it”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-everyone-in-this-world-is-specatular>‘Everyone in this world is specatular’</h2><p>However, one fan said the real thing was much better: “Her acceptance speech was much more memorable”.</p><p>In her actual speech, she had some words of advice to her fellow artists and her fans.</p><p>The 31-year-old said: “This award is amazing. But I really hope that it doesn’t change anything because my life was beautiful yesterday. Not everyone in the world will get a Grammy, but everyone in this world is spectacular.</p><p>“So please don’t think that this is important, even though it’s very important, right guys?”</p><p>She also won a gong for Best Pop Solo Performance, and was handed the award by Mariah Carey, which blew her mind.</p><p>In the second Grammys’ speech of the night, Miley Cyrus said: “This M.C. is going to stand by&nbsp;this&nbsp;M.C. because this is just too iconic.</p><p>“Oh my god, I just got stuck in the rain and traffic and thought I was going to miss this moment. And I could have missed the award — that’s fine — but not Mariah Carey! I just saw you at the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> Bowl. It was everything.”</p><p>“There was a little boy that all he wanted for his birthday was a butterfly,” Cyrus added. “So his parents gave him a butterfly net and he was so excited. He went outside out in the sun and started swinging and swinging. But with no luck, he sat down on the ground, he finally let go and he surrendered. He was okay that he was not going to capture this beautiful butterfly.</p><p>“Right when he did is when the butterfly came and landed right on the tip of his nose. And this song, ‘Flowers,’ is my butterfly. Thank you.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WCcLPRmqSmsaNiuqq4xLJknLGiqsBur9GinJ1llKq%2FqrrGZp%2Beql2WsKSxz62Yp5uVYsCxscScn2annmK1orrNmp9mpZ%2BjwaK6wGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heiress-daughter-billionaire-pharma-tycoon-branded-entitled-judge-refuses-award-228m-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Heiress daughter of billionaire pharma tycoon branded 'entitled' by judge who refuses to award $228m</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./538997-diamond-holds-hands-zari-hassan-catchy-video-calls-sister-watu-sio-wajinga.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Diamond Holds Hands with Ex Zari Hassan in Catchy Video, Calls Her 'Sister': &amp;quot;Watu Sio Wajinga&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
