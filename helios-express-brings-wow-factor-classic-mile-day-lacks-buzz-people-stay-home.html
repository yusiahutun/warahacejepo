There has been a massive change in consumer behaviour and people stay home,” said Jockey Club chief executive Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges.</p><p>“We have to review what we do to encourage race-going. We want to create an atmosphere and we have certain races, when we put significant promotion up, it works.</p><p>“But our average race-going crowd is less because people were practically excluded [from the racecourse] for three years and therefore it is a massive change in behaviour. That is my big concern.</p><p>“We have to see what we can do to encourage people to come out to Sha Tin. Happy Valley is relatively normal, but especially Sha Tin is something we are reviewing.”</p><h3><a title href=# data-entity-uuid=df0d0d98-98ab-482d-b83f-064d5b3958ee data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article>Helios Express shows star qualities with Classic Mile romp at Sha Tin</a></h3><p>Happy Valley’s midweek meetings are, of course, much less about the racing than Sha Tin, with the beer garden and its live music a melting pot of tourists and the city’s after-work crowd.</p><p>Engelbrecht-Bresges suggested areas like food and beverage, entertainment and loyalty programmes would be explored further at Sha Tin, with performances by big-name local acts used to generate interest among different demographics already this season.</p><p>There must also be merit in looking into how feature meetings that aren’t marquee events like the Longines Hong Kong International Races can be spiced up.</p><p>The nine-runner Classic Mile looked underwhelming on paper and, outside the sparkling showing of Helios Express, felt like little more than any other race.</p><img

post-race presentation that goes hand in hand with Hong Kong’s big races and – I hope you’re sitting down – slightly fancier saddlecloths, but generally there was nothing of any great substance pre-race aimed at generating excitement on course.</p><p>Engelbrecht-Bresges talks of needing to attract fans on multiple occasions before they are hooked – “we know from our statistics, if people go to the races seven times or more, the stickiness of the product is much higher” – and officials will be hoping next Monday’s Lunar New Year meeting can act as a starting point for some much-needed momentum.</p><p>More than 80,000 people streamed through the gates last Lunar New Year and attendance exceeded 105,000 in 2019, ensuring next Monday’s card will provide yet another revealing measuring stick.</p><h4><strong>Cup attracts just six</strong></h4><p>While officials are hoping next Monday’s meeting attracts a sizeable crowd, the afternoon’s feature – the Class One Chinese New Year Cup (1,400m) – has done anything but.</p><p>Just six gallopers, the fewest since 2019, have been entered for the contest and the Jockey Club’s racing registry had to battle just to reach half a dozen.</p><h3><a title href=# data-entity-uuid=2351cb4c-4df2-41ee-8670-9c740b7e17f3 data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article>Red-hot Ricky Yiu looks to extend purple patch with Happy Valley specialist</a></h3><p>While the 95-plus rated race initially had just four entries, the Jockey Club lowered the minimum rating to 90 on Monday morning and managed to rustle up two more runners.</p><p>It then had another crack, lowering the minimum to 85, but that failed to flush out any further Class Two seven-furlong specialists.</p><p>That leaves Courier Wonder, Duke Wai, Super Wealthy, Red Lion, Running Glory and Mugen to do battle in the HK$3.72 million contest.</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid
