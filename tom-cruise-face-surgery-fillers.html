He still looks hot."</p><p>Another wrote: "Crikey, Tom Cruise looks like Tom Cruise again" - after photos of the star at a baseball game in San Francisco last year showed him sporting a much fuller-face.</p><p>At the time fans questioned whether he'd had botched fillers, with one tweeting: "What has Tom Cruise done to his face?"</p><p>With his boyish good looks and absence of frown lines, plastic surgery rumours have dogged the actor for years.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON TOM CRUISE">READ MORE ON TOM CRUISE</h2><p>Although he has consistently denied going under the knife, fans have speculated the ever-youthful star has had a nose job, hair transplant and Botox, as well as veneers on his teeth.</p><p>Alice Henshaw, owner and practitioner of <a href=#>Harley Street Injectables</a>, previously told The Sun rumours of a hair transplant might be spot on.</p><p>"At almost 60, Tom's hairline has remained relatively the same, although slightly thinning, which does suggest he may have had hair transplants."</p><p>As the debate is reignited, here we look at how the star's face has changed over the years.</p><img

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000313837091.jpg><p>Tom's signature smile has always been part of his charm but he wasn’t born with a perfect grin.</p><p>When he starred in The Outsiders, in 1982, his teeth were visibly yellowed and misaligned, with a pronounced overbite.</p><p>He also removed a cap on a chipped front tooth to appear even more menacing.</p><p>But when leading man status beckoned, with roles like Maverick in Top Gun, he had his teeth whitened to improve the look.</p><h2><strong>1986</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ed88dce0-6c3b-4c87-b572-749cf1114972.jpg><p>As his career reached dizzying heights, with the release of <a href=#>Top Gun</a> in 1996, the 24-year-old still had much of his boyish charm and lean face.</p><p>His role as young naval aviator&nbsp;Lieutenant Pete "Maverick" Mitchell cemented him as a Hollywood heartthrob.</p><h2>1996</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/46394818-28c9-4260-8bba-e1b25e417ebf.jpg><p>In an unusual look for the clean-cut movie legend, Tom mixed it up in 1996 with some rugged facial hair and long flowing locks.</p><p>That year he took on the title role in Jerry Maguire, for which he earned a Golden Globe and his second nomination for an Academy Award.</p><h2>2002</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9bcd7b39-e8a3-4bb2-a63f-ff34d5040f1c.jpg><p>It wasn’t until 2001, after splitting from Nicole Kidman, that Tom got braces to rectify his overbite, proudly showing them off at the premiere of Minority Report.&nbsp;</p><p>But fans still commented on his asymmetrical teeth, which saw one front tooth aligned with the centre of his face.</p><h2>2006</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2394f46a-c64f-4019-80bd-445dacda2880.jpg><p>At 44, Tom looked less gaunt than he did in his youth, having grown into his face.</p><p>His chiselled jaw and killer smile had female fans falling at his feet.</p><h2>2010</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/d1099f87-c499-49fa-80c1-7dbc39da634a.jpg><p>By 2010, Tom's face was beginning to change, occasionally looking chubbier, possibly due to weight flunctuation.</p><p>The superfit star <a href=#>pushed himself to the limit</a> whenever he was filming a stunt-filled action role but would also put on a few pounds between movies.</p><h2><strong>2012</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/b20407f3-f080-4f3f-bd42-55593f2364ad.jpg><p>Rumours the star had undergone a nose job began back in 2012 but, asked by Playboy magazine if he had ever had surgery, he replied: “I haven’t and never would.”</p><p>But pal Cuba Gooding Jr fanned the flames by insisting Tom had “absolutely” had work done.</p><p>Cuba told a US TV show: "I don’t know what he’s had done, but I remember I surprised him at his house one day and he had all of these dots all over his face.</p><p>"I was like, 'You all right?' and he goes, 'I didn’t know you were coming' and I was like, 'I can see why.'"</p><p>Alice Henshaw explained the dots could indicate many types of surgical or non surgical procedures to make the skin tighter and younger-looking.</p><p>She said: "Often dots or markings are drawn on whilst we mark out injection points on the face, but we do this for filler injectables, Profhilo (a collagen stimulator) or even a skin tightening procedure using radio frequency such as Thermage, or a medical grade ultrasound skin tightening like ultraformer."</p><h2>2016</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000214702436.jpg><p>Tom's appearance at the 2016 BAFTAs had fans commenting on how he looked "inflated" and "puffy" - a common sign of both Botox and fillers.</p><p>"Tom looked as if he had undereye filler and filler around his mouth and nasal labial fold in 2016," said Alice.</p><p>"But the recent pictures at the baseball match show swelling that doesn't come with fillers."</p><p>Dental experts also suggested he had veneers added to make his dazzling smile even whiter.</p><h2>2018</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/e41edae4-7cdd-4d5e-aa0b-e51a8c6fb6b8.jpg><p>At the Mission Impossible: Fallout premiere in 2018, Tom looked leaner, with more lines showing on his forehead.</p><p>While this could be down to a punishing exercise regime and work schedule for the film, which he also produced, it could also mean he ditched fillers and Botox after the 2016 pictures attracted unwanted attention.</p><h2>2021</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000685681867-1.jpg><p>Snaps of the star at a baseball game last year raised eyebrows once again. They came hot on the heels of snaps of Tom at a <a href=#>Birmingham curry house</a> where his face also looked "puffy".</p><p>Alice said it could be Tom - like many of us - just put on a few pounds during lockdown.</p><p>"It would be hard to say whether it was weight gain without seeing full photo of his body," she added.</p><p>However he didn't appear to be carrying excess weight during summer appearances at Wimbledon and Wembley.</p><p>Alice said the <a href=#>Mission Impossible</a> star looks "swollen" - potentially after going under the knife.</p><p>"Tom definitely looks swollen and puffy, which could be due to filler, post procedure swelling or weight gain," she explained.</p><p>"I believe he's had fillers under his eyes and around his mouth and nose in the past, but this time is different.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"A side profile view of him shows his neck is also quite swollen. Filler would not be placed in this area, which signifies it would not be filler but rather swelling or weight gain.</p><p>"Often surgical procedure such as a platysmal plasty, or neck lift, combined with a mid-facelift could create this type of swelling in these areas, and scars are easily disguised."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000674525205.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000665253745.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6cf5b8bd-f583-42df-9a11-52815fa58275.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Tom Cruise stuns family by landing a helicopter in their back garden for MI- 7 filming and takes kids for a ride</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hraGl9eHyPaKuopV2Yv7a10p5kn5mTmnq0wdGgnKuxXZu2rbjEq6po</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./article-18406bac-c756-11ed-8776-b73016f5fd32-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>LATER, GATOR | Free News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./florida-woman-murdered-boyfriend-55-dismembered-body-hid-pieces-trailer-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title></p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
