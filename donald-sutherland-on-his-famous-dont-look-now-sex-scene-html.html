But Trump wasn’t necessarily meant to be a theme of the film, Sutherland told Vulture in a recent conversation: “It was an American artifact that an Italian director driving down the road in a 1973 Winnebago with an English actress and a Canadian actor sees.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz71qz00203i62gzr4hg67@published data-word-count=55>Instead, Sutherland sees the theme of The Leisure Seeker as the intimacy between a couple that’s been together for decades — a delicate, emotional, and sensual bond, something rarely seen in films, especially by actors of this caliber. However good both Sutherland and Mirren are, they’re even better together, which is thrilling to watch onscreen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz71qv001z3i6299im4rim@published data-word-count=58>Before the film’s release, Vulture caught up with Sutherland to talk about his love for Mirren — and an important lesson she taught him. He also talked about his infamous sex scene with Julie Christie in Don’t Look Now; his wife of 46 years, Francine; and how he feels he owes his career to the critic Renata Adler.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz723h002v3i62x5izknsw@published data-word-count=23><strong>Is this the first time you’ve worked with Helen Mirren?</strong><br>No. We played man and wife 30 years ago, in a film called Bethune.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz71tb00213i62b87qmqui@published data-word-count=21><strong>You’re so wonderful together.</strong><br>I’m so sorry she’s — we just normally do interviews together, at which time I don’t say anything!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz71td00233i62ukf4eun7@published data-word-count=9><strong>Really? </strong><strong><br></strong>Yeah.

We were just sitting talking and suddenly she turns around and says, “You’re the most privileged person in the world.” I went, “No I’m not, actually.” I’ve had a very good life and I’ve earned some money, but I don’t have much. But I’ve been fortunate, that’s for sure. She went, “No, you’re the most privileged person in the world.” And I went, “What are you talking about, Helen?” And she said, “You’re a white male.” And I went, “Okay.”</p><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-GTI5iqIK"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Helen Mirren Is Ready to Record Her Shakespearean Rap Album</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz71ti00263i628e64s0hg@published data-word-count=10><strong>You thought about it?</strong><strong><br></strong>Yeah.

Maybe she’ll know from this.</strong><br>Forever, I’ve always had in my head, if I was ever awarded an Oscar, I would thank Ingwald Preminger, Robert Aldrich, Brian Hutton, and Renata Adler. It was so important to me, that review. When I walked down the hall to go see my agent they all said, “Hey what’d you do? Renata blah blah …” They just thought it was dumb that she would say those things about me, because they didn’t have much hope for my future. And it gave me a great sense of purpose.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz71vs002b3i621ujljgnb@published data-word-count=20><strong>Do you remember some of the highlights that she said about you?</strong><br>[Laughs, then lisps.] She said I had a lisp!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz71vy002c3i62exu0xcm0@published data-word-count=18><strong>She also said you were an attractive gopher.</strong><br>Exactly.

Then he said, “I’m going to get married next month.” I said congratulations. He said, “Can you answer a question for me?” And I said, “Well, I’ll try.” He said, “My fiancée finds you attractive. Why?”<br><br><strong>That leads to your new movie, which was a really wonderful depiction of intimacy between an older couple.</strong><br>You know something, the film with Julie Christie, Don’t Look Now, was a depiction of married intimacy. There’s a scene where they make love in the movie, and it’s not voyeuristic. You don’t watch people making love. What happens when you watch it is you remember having made love, having been in love yourself. And I think so, too, with this one. You understand the love your parents feel. You understand that these people, who are so much older than you are, have a life and a future, have a sexual existence, have a sensual existence. The fact that they’re 40 years older than you are, it doesn’t change who they think they are.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz71xt002e3i62cnf4xtjr@published data-word-count=153><strong>That’s an interesting comparison with Don’t Look Now, because that still gets listed as one of the best sex scenes ever made.</strong><br>But it’s not a sex scene … You know something, you know how that was shot? It was shot with unblimped Arriflex cameras. We were in a room by ourselves. I don’t know about Julie, but I’m never naked in front of somebody! I’m not even naked in front of my children. I’m naked in front of my wife — that’s it. I was shy. For a couple of very specific reasons, she was physically shy. But we got over our shyness, went into the room, and were standing like Adam and Eve waiting for somebody to give us an apple. And in one corner was Nic Roeg, and right beside him was [cinematographer] Tony Richmond. They had two unblimped Arriflexes. An unblimped Arriflex sounds like a Singer sewing machine on methamphetamines.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz71y2002f3i62p07ox1l4@published data-word-count=98><strong>Really?</strong><br>Oh yeah. [Makes loud AAAAAAGHHHHHH noise.] It’s like that! You can’t do sound with it. So there was no sound. They were very short, 15- to 20-second takes. It was literally like, “Julie, tilt your back. Donald, put your head towards her.” AAAAAAGHHHHHH. “Now Julie, move your head to the side.” AAAAAAGHHHHHH. It was like that! The whole thing. It took your gut away from you. But then, what [Roeg] did, was he cut it together with getting dressed. It was perfect. No sound, just music. I’m very proud of that. I have a son named after him.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz71y3002g3i625lmjvabc@published data-word-count=1><strong>Roeg?</strong><strong><br></strong>Yes.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz71y6002h3i62gtdoar8s@published data-word-count=55><strong>Your first line [in The Leisure Seeker] is: “You farted, darling.” And all the way to the end it’s about all of these moments of intimacy, not just the sex scene.</strong><br>Yeah, yeah, yeah … That’s what it’s about.

She’s one of the great farters of the world.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz71yb002i3i62dw5ip4in@published data-word-count=15><strong>How long have you been together?</strong><br>My wife and I?

I didn’t look at people who suffered from Alzheimer’s or dementia. I looked at a woman named Teepa Snow who trains caregivers for dementia patients. I studied what she was treating and why, how they would confront certain things. So it was kind of reverse engineering. John wasn’t copied, he just came, and he was just born. Oh, it sounds so stupid when I say it … [laughs]. He was born, and he took over. Periodically, the character that I played would speak. From inside me he would speak.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz720b002m3i62jqrkdd8s@published data-word-count=26><strong>So he was born inside you, and he lived inside you …</strong><br>He lives inside me now.

When men at that time discover — their impotency overwhelms them. Masculinity was so important to Hemingway. I think it’s fine to go and shoot yourself. I just don’t know why he was walking outside, and he did it inside. He did it in the living room before he got outside. That’s an awful mess for people to have to clean up afterwards. Something about that has a complete and utter lack of elegance for me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjefz7227002p3i62m2fm0rom@published data-word-count=56>I had a friend who jumped off a bridge in Toronto.
