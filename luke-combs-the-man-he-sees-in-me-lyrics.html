In January, the proud father of two shared an <a href=#>unreleased track</a> titled "The Man He Sees in Me" with fans. The song speaks to his new role as a&nbsp;dad and how he wants to be viewed in the eyes of both of his young sons, Tex and Beau.</p><h3>Who Are Luke Combs' Kids?</h3><p>The "Where the Wild Things Are" singer became a father on June 19, 2022 with the arrival of Tex Lawrence Combs. It wasn't too long before&nbsp;Combs, and his wife, Nicole,&nbsp;joined the "two under two" club, when baby Beau was born on Aug. 15, 2023.</p><p>The couple has opted to keep their children's privacy safe and don't post photos of their boys on social media very often. On the rare occasion that they do share a picture, they&nbsp;obscure their sons' faces.</p><p>Combs admits that many of the songs he has been writing lately are inspired by his role as a father and have appropriately been written during his shifts on "dad duty," while Nicole showers or works out.</p><h3>Here Are Luke Combs' "The Man He Sees in Me" Lyrics</h3><p>He’s Spider-Man in Walmart boots / And a camouflage hat / With a baby blue Zebco / That gets hung up every cast</p><p>He thinks he’s learning fishing / From the man that taught Bill Dance / And I think as I untangle it and put it in his hands</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong></p><p>I hope he never finds out that I didn’t hang the moon / And I’ve never scared a monster out the closet in his room / Someday between him leaving home and driving on my knee / Maybe I’ll finally be, the man he sees in me</p><p>He waves his blanket like a checkered flag / Pulling off of the interstate / With a happy meal cup held high / Like I won the big race</p><p>When we get inside, his mind is blown / When I untie his shoes / And he smiles and says, “Daddy, there ain’t nothing you can’t do”</p><p><strong>Chorus</strong></p><p>I know he’s gonna find out that I didn’t hang the moon / There never was a monster in the closet of his room</p><p>Someday when he’s driving home with his son on his knee / I hope he’s trying to be the man he sees in me / The man he sees in me</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 20 Luke Combs Songs That Prove 'Em All Wrong</h2><p>Check out Luke Combs' best songs, and the songs that changed his life when so many thought he wasn't good enough to be a country star.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Luke Combs and Nicole Combs' Cutest Pics Prove They're Better Together</h2><p>After meeting at a music festival in 2016, Luke Combs and his wife Nicole has been inseparable.
