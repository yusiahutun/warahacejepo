Sogyal, who is 70, is a portly, bespectacled man who requires a footstool to mount the throne from which he customarily teaches. Approaching the throne, he paused, then turned suddenly and punched the nun hard in the stomach.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855Ax class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“I guess the footstool wasn’t in exactly the right position,” says Gary Goldman, an American student of more than 20 years standing, who was seated in one of the front rows. “He had this flash of anger, and he just punched her – a short gut punch. Everybody around me kind of sucked their breath in. She started crying, and he told her to leave, get out, and then he started to talk.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855gPB class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“To see the master not as a human being but as the Buddha himself,” Sogyal has often told his students, “is the source of the highest blessing.” Those attending his teachings are caution­ed not to be surprised or to draw “the wrong conclusions” about the way he might behave. Apparently irrational, even violent conduct, it is said, should be viewed as “mere appearance”.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855vIB class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>But punching a nun in the stomach ...</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855X2G class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“Afterwards, everybody was trying to make sense of what had happened,” Goldman says. “People were very upset.” It was customary for students at the retreat to email any thoughts or ques­tions they might have on the day’s teachings to Sogyal’s senior instructors.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855cnD class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>As a young man, Goldman was a United States Army ranger who served in Vietnam. “We all wrote something up,” he says. “I said, I understood his methods were uncon­ventional but punching Ani Chökyi was knocking the ball out of the park.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/04/3a8d73a8-a727-11e7-ac3e-6a4e39b7ad7c_1320x770_170513.JPG><p datatype="p" class="noindent c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101576927855WY data-qa=Component-Component>“I’ve seen this kind of thing in the military and we don’t do that any more – at least not legally.

Sogyal, he said, was upset that people should be questioning his methods. If people didn’t understand what had actually happened, then they probably weren’t ready for the promised higher-level teachings, and Sogyal would not teach again during the retreat.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855JM class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“This is what he does,” Goldman says, “when something comes up he’ll very skilfully manipulate his students to get them back in line. I just thought, ‘I’m done with this.’”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855a3D class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Largely thanks to the benign, smil­ing example of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism has grown enormously in popularity in the West over the past 30 years, for the most part escap­ing the scandal that has dogged other religious institutions – at least publicly.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855rCE class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Within the Buddhist community, however, Sogyal Rinpoche has long been a controversial figure. For years, rumours have circulated on the internet about his behaviour and, in the 1990s, a lawsuit alleging sexual and physical abuse was settled out of court. Yet his position as one of the foremost Buddhist teachers in the West has remain­ed remarkably intact – until now.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855McE class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>In July, eight senior and long-standing current and former students sent a 12-page letter to Sogyal. “Long simmering issues with your behaviour,” it began, “can no longer be ignored or denied”, going on to list a catalogue of damning allegations against him.</p><p datatype="p" id=U1015769278556p class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Sogyal’s habitual physical abuse, the letter alleged, had “left monks, nuns, and lay people students of yours with bloody injuries and permanent scars”. He had used his role as a teacher “to gain access to young women, and to coerce, intimidate and manipulate them into giving you sexual favours”. Students had been ordered to strip, “to show you our genitals”, “to give you oral sex” and “to have sex in your bed with our partners”.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855TVF class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Sogyal, it went on, had led a “lavish, gluttonous and sybar­itic lifestyle”, which had been kept secret from the large body of his followers, and financed by donations by students “who believe their offering is being used to further wisdom and compassion in the world”.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">You want to progress on the spiritual path, and by sleeping with the teacher you get a closeness to him which everyone is hankering after</figure><p datatype="p" class="noindent c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101576927855mJB data-qa=Component-Component>“If your striking and punching us and others, and having sex with your students and married women, and funding your sybaritic lifestyle with students’ donations is actually the ethical and compassionate behaviour of a Buddhist teacher, please explain to us how it is.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855vhG class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Copied to the Dalai Lama, and Sogyal’s most senior students, the letter quickly went viral, shaking the foundation of Rigpa to the core. For Sogyal himself it was the prelude to the most spectacular fall from grace.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855U5E class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>More than just a sordid story of an errant spiritual teacher, the case of Sogyal Rinpoche is a symptom of the perils that may arise when Westerners fall in thrall to esoteric spiritual teachings they may not fully understand, and when Eastern teachers are exposed to the glamour and temptations of celebrity worship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/04/4b0c735a-a727-11e7-ac3e-6a4e39b7ad7c_1320x770_170513.JPG><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855fNB class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Sogyal Lakar was born in Kham, in the east of Tibet, into a family of traders. Among his followers, he is believed to be the reincarnation of Sogyal Terton, a Tibetan lama who was a teacher of the 13th Dalai Lama (the present Dalai Lama is the 14th). But according to Rob Hogendoorn, a Dutch academic and Buddhist who has researched Sogyal’s background, the only authority for that claim appears to be Sogyal’s own mother. Sogyal had little formal Buddhist train­ing, and it is notable that few in the Tibetan commu­nity have ever attended his teachings.</p><p datatype="p" id=U1015769278559qG class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>When he was six months old, his mother put him in the care of her sister, Khandro Tsering Chodron, who was the young consort – or spiritual wife – of an eminent Tibetan lama, Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro, who became Sogyal’s effective guardian.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855tTC class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>In 1954, the family fled from the invading Chinese army to Kalimpong, in West Bengal, where Sogyal was educated at a Catholic primary school, St Augustine’s. Jamyang Khyentse died when Sogyal was 10 or 11, and his education continued at an Anglican school, St Stephen’s College in Delhi. In 1971, he arrived at Trinity College Cambridge, in Britain, to study theo­logical and religious studies, although he never graduated.</p><p datatype="p" id=U1015769278552KG class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>It was in Cambridge that he met Mary Finnigan, then a young Buddhist student, now an author and Sogyal’s fiercest critic, who has been assiduous in her chronicling of his alleged misdemeanours.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855QRB class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>At that time, there were only four Tibetan lamas living in the country.</p><p datatype="p" class="noindent c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101576927855qcF data-qa=Component-Component>“There was nobody teaching in London and there were no centres,” Finnigan says. She arranged Sogyal’s first teachings, in the squat where she was living in London, and would remain his student until 1979.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855U class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Sogyal was an exotic presence; a Tibetan who could speak fluent English and seemed to know what he was talking about. His following rapidly grew, and with a £100,000 donation from a well-known British comedy actor he was able to establish his first centre in London.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855rfG class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Assuming the honorific Rinpoche (it means “precious one”) Sogyal set himself up as a teacher in the Vajrayana, or tantric, tradition – a deeply esoteric aspect of Tibetan Buddhism, through which, it is believed, a student can unshackle the chains of ego and attain enlightenment in a single lifetime – “the helicopter to the top of the mountain”, as Sogyal has put it.</p><p datatype="p" id=U10157692785505C class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>It involves the student giving total obedience to the lama in the belief that whatever the lama does, no matter how irrational or incomprehensible it may seem, is for the student’s benefit. Whatever doubts might arise in the mind of the student about these methods is due to “impure perception”.</p><p datatype="p" id=U1015769278554uC class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Tibetan Buddhist lore is filled with stories of great masters – or mahasiddhas – bringing their pupils to enlightenment by methods that appear to verge on madness.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855ADE class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>One of the most famous involves the 11th-century maha­siddha Naropa, whose teacher, Tilopa, subjected him to a series of ordeals including leaping from the top of a temple and breaking his bones, jumping into fire and freezing water, and giving his wife to Tilopa as an offering. According to these stories, every time Naropa was broken or near death, Tilopa would heal him with the wave of a hand, giving him an instruc­tion that would bring Naropa’s mind to a more advanced level.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855AHH class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Fundamental to this relationship between master and disciple is the bond of samaya, or trust, in which the pupil not only vows total obedience to the guru, but the guru vows to act only for the benefit of the pupil. Breaking samaya is held to have the most grave consequences, including banishment to “vajra hell” and an infinity of unfortunate rebirths.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855KwC class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“Once you enter into the hermetic world of Tibetan Buddhism, you somehow burn your bridges to Western ration­ality,” says Stephen Batchelor, a British Buddhist teacher and academic who was himself a Tibetan Buddhist monk for eight years. “You enter a world that appears to be entirely con­sistent internally; everything makes sense; the structures of power seem to be in the service of these high ideals of enlighten­ment, and the relationship with the guru is the key element in your capacity to follow this path in the most effective way.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855FaC class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>But the Vajrayana is recognised as a hazardous path, particularly to Western students without a deep ground­ing in Tibetan culture.</p><p datatype="p" id=U1015769278556DD class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>In characteristically lighthearted style, the Dalai Lama has spoken of his own caution in discussing the Vajrayana path. “I have to be careful what I say in teaching, as there are some seekers who might take the Naropa story literally and jump off a cliff, thinking the guru was hinting about it. Not only do I not have the ability to heal the broken body with a wave of my hand, but here in Dharamsala we don’t even have a proper ambulance service!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/04/58dc5a36-a727-11e7-ac3e-6a4e39b7ad7c_600x_170513.JPG>The Dalai Lama has cautioned putative students that a good test of a teacher who is beyond attachments and the temptations of self-gratification is whether they can eat a piece of excrement with the same equanimity as a piece of food. Asked which Tibetan teachers were of a sufficiently high level of self-realisation to do this, he replied: “Zero”.<p datatype="p" id=U101576927855kR class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>In 1976, Sogyal visited America to meet with another Tibetan lama, Chogyam Trungpa, who was regarded as the most extreme exemplar of “crazy wisdom” teachings. Trungpa drank like a fish (he would die in 1987 from complications arising due to alcoholism), openly slept with his students and ran his organisation like a feudal court, surrounding himself with an elite bodyguard, sometimes amusing himself by dressing as a Grenadier guard. “The real function of the guru,” he once said, “is to insult you.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855gaF class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“Sogyal looked at what Trungpa had,” Finnigan says, “and said, ‘That’s what I want.’”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855UOD class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Like Trungpa, he adopted an unorthodox, often jokey, teaching style, but he was a compelling orator, with an ability to hold an audience in the palm of his hand and convey the Buddhist teachings in a clear and understandable way.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855eKG class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“There are three kinds of people who show up for spiritual practice or information,” Goldman says. “You get the intellec­tuals who are curious and want to learn something about it; you get the people who are actively seeking truth, and looking to figure out what life and the world is about; and then you get the people who are totally psychologically f****d up – they’ve been abused, terrible things have happened to them. Sogyal was able to satisfy all three groups, very well and very compassionately.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855QbC class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>In 1992, he published The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, which presented traditional Tibetan teachings on a happy life and good death for a Western audience. Clinicians, hospice workers and psychologists applauded it for the com­fort it brought to the terminally ill. Comedian John Cleese (Monty Python, Fawlty Towers), an early supporter, described it as “one of the most helpful books I have ever read”.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855DxC class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>It was a runaway success, but quite how much Sogyal himself had to do with it is debatable; according to those close to the project, most of the work was done by ghost­writers, including Sogyal’s closest student, and now his right-hand man, Patrick Gaffney.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855Ph class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>The book made Sogyal a celebrity. He appeared in Bernardo Bertolucci’s film Little Buddha (1993) and he travelled the world, establishing centres. The combination of Sogyal’s charisma – a purveyor of ancient wisdom in touch with the modern world – and the mystique of Tibetan Buddhism proved a potent lure. Those signing up for his courses had little idea that, as one former follower puts it, Sogyal was “using meditation as a gateway drug into a cult of personality”.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855FKC class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>But the first storm clouds were gathering. Sogyal is not a monk, and there is theoretically no prohibition on him marrying or having sexual relations. But his sexual conduct was becoming a cause of increasing controversy in Buddhist circles – not least his surrounding himself with an effective harem of young women, whom Sogyal described as his “dakinis” – a Tibetan term meaning spiritual muse.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855v0C class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>In 1994, an American student using the legal pseudonym Janice Doe brought a suit against Sogyal, alleging that using the justification of his spiritual status he had sexually and physically abused her, turning her against her husband and family. This, the charge alleged, was merely one example of a pattern of abuse against a number of women.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855OyF class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Britain’s Telegraph Magazine published a cover story on the case in which two British women spoke about their own sexual encounters with Sogyal.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855cmD class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“You’re chosen, which makes you feel special,” said one. “Because he was my spiritual teacher I trusted that whatever he asked was in my best interests […] You want to progress on the spiritual path, and by sleeping with the teacher you get a closeness to him which everyone is hankering after. I saw it as part of the teachings on the illusory nature of experience and emotions. But, in fact, it caused me a lot of pain that I wasn’t able to dissolve.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/04/527b717c-a727-11e7-ac3e-6a4e39b7ad7c_600x_170513.JPG>The other spoke of her distress at discovering, soon after he initiated a relationship with her, that Sogyal was also having sex with three other students. Sogyal, she said, had “used the teachings to attempt to keep me in a sexual relationship with him – one that I did not want to be in.”<p datatype="p" id=U101576927855rjG class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>The Janice Doe case was settled quietly out of court. And in a pre-internet age, most readers of The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying remained happily oblivious to any hint of scandal. Rather, the book was to prove a powerful medium in bringing him new followers. Among them was a young Australian woman, who would later become a Buddhist nun, taking the name Drolma.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855eQC class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Drolma first read Sogyal’s book as a 21-year-old. “I thought, ‘That’s all very nice, but I don’t need this,’ and put it back on my bookshelf.” Two years later, with her life “falling apart” follow­ing an abortion and the break-up of a difficult relationship, she attended a retreat where Sogyal was teaching in New South Wales.</p><p datatype="p" id=U1015769278559GC class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“My life was at a point where I had no understanding of the suffering I was going through, and this provided some answers, and some practical steps, like meditation,” Drolma says.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855SNH class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>She became more involved in Rigpa, travelling to Lerab Ling for retreats and facilitating study groups.

Several ex-followers have described how Sogyal would sometimes address his closest students while defecating, ordering his dakinis to perform the appro­priate ablutions as a demonstration of “service”. It is further alleged that among his inner circle, Sogyal frequently took the wives or girlfriends of his most loyal male followers as his sexual partners, either openly or covertly. Men were expected to accept this as part of the teaching. When one complained, Sogyal told his partner the man was “possessed by demons”.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855iRG class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>The eight-signatory letter further alleges that on at least one occasion, Sogyal had offered one of his female attendants to another lama for sex.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855d1F class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>For a woman to be chosen by Sogyal as a sexual partner was regarded as “an honour”, Drolma says. “It meant they had dakini qualities, and you’re said to be prolonging the life of the master.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855z5F class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>The offerings expected from followers kept Sogyal in a lifestyle of profligate extravagance. At Lerab Ling, he lived in a chalet decorated with cedar-wood panels that overlooked his own heated swimming pool. There was a giant television on which he enjoyed watching his favourite American action movies. In the “lama kitchen”, attendants were available day and night to provide his favourite dishes at a moment’s notice.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855CZH class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>In the months that Sogyal was at Lerab Ling, or whenever she travelled with him, Drolma worked 14-hour days, six days a week. “It was always about survival and addressing his most immediate needs for fear of the repercussions if you didn’t.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855pDF class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>On foreign trips, he travelled first class, his retinue with him. Oane Bijlsma, a Dutch woman who joined Rigpa in 2011, going on to become one of Sogyal’s attendants, describes how for an Easter teaching in Britain in 2012, Rigpa took over Haileybury, a public school in Hertfordshire. Sogyal was installed in the music teacher’s house. On his instruction, his students carefully photographed each room, then moved every stick of furniture into storage, replacing it with furnish­ings more suited to Sogyal’s tastes, including a large flat-screen television with satellite connection. At the end of the six-day teaching, the rooms were restored to their original state. Oane, who was in charge of provisions, was instructed to visit local butchers, taking photographs of the best joints of meat, which she had to submit for Sogyal’s approval, before buying them.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855cyG class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“I was shopping for groceries with hundreds of pounds in my pocket in cash. I was buying ridiculous amounts of the best meats I could get. And the wine and the roses and the chocolates ... And then people in the inner circle would be on stage at the teachings talking about Sogyal living a modest life, and keeping nothing for himself. It was totally obscene.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855DYF class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“In Tibet a lama would have been under much more control,” one former follower says. “The system would have curbed his excesses. But Sogyal has been surrounded by Western followers who believe that everything he says and does is perfect. It’s a disaster for him, and a disaster for every­body else. He completely lost touch with reality.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855GXF class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>For some within Rigpa, the paradox between being beaten and abused while being told it was for their benefit was causing predictable problems.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855G4 class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“It creates split personalities in people,” one student says. “People feel a loyalty to the teachings which is constantly being contradicted by Sogyal’s behaviour; their hearts are split in two.”</p><p datatype="p" class="noindent c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101576927855XdB data-qa=Component-Component>In 2007, Sogyal introduced a programme that he called Rigpa Therapy, in which a number of qualified psychothera­pists, who were also Rigpa students, were assigned to treat those entertaining doubts about the teachings. Drolma was among them.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855yFG class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“The crux of every session,” she says, “was exploring how what Sogyal did related to other past relationships in my life. It was all about that, and how my difficulties were nothing to do with Sogyal, and how his blessing was letting me go back to that time and work through it. Basically, the therapists had been brought in to stop people leaving.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855w1H class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>At around the same time, Drolma appeared in a German film about Sogyal, Ancient Wisdom For the Modern World (2008), discussing her relationship with him. “Sometimes he’ll be like my father, like my mother, like my boss, like my friend – like my enemy, because he pushes my buttons,” she said. “But I know always his heart and his motivation is so pure.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855tSE class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“He’s always showing me who I am and who I’m not. The buttons he presses are not who I truly am. The buttons he presses are what needs to be removed. Sometimes there’s a joy when they’re pressed, because it’s showing what needs to be peeled away. Whenever there’s any pain, that’s not the real me hurting; that’s the ego that Rinpoche is trying to eradicate.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855aE class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Senior instructors congratulated her on her appearance but her doubts were hardening. “I’d reached saturation point,” Drolma says. She confided her feelings to a visiting Spanish nun. “I’d always been trained to keep everything secret from anyone outside, but I ended up telling her everything. She said, ‘That’s straight out abuse. You’ve got to leave.’”</p><p datatype="p" id=U1015769278555II class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>In 2010, she travelled to Taiwan with three other nuns from Lerab Ling for monastic training. She returned to France, but not to Lerab Ling, hiding out in Paris, ignoring Sogyal’s telephone calls. She fled to India, living in a nunnery, before finally going home to Australia. In 2011, she summoned the nerve to go back to Lerab Ling, for the cremation of Sogyal’s aunt, Khandro.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855huD class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done,” she says. “I was in nun’s robes and still keeping my precepts. Wearing robes you have one arm bare, and he touched me there, as if I were a sexual object. It made my skin crawl.” The cremation over, she returned to Australia, and gave up her robes.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855cqC class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“Looking back,” she says, “I think I’d lost all faculty of being able to discern clearly what was going on.

Sogyal, he said, “did not hesitate to brutally silence and ridicule people in meetings. Critical thinking is prohibited around him.

The most important was for Sogyal’s followers to “repair any impairments of the samaya” – their vow of trust between guru and student – by embarking on an intensive practice of reciting mantras. The goal, Gaffney wrote, was to accumulate 100 million 100 syllable mantras every year – a practice that would require 3,000 students chanting for 40 minutes a day.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855rnD class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“If the practices he recommends are done,” Gaffney went on, “then there is every chance that Rinpoche will live until at least the age of 85.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U1015769278551yF class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Some saw it as a subtle way of dampening the growing scandal, and coercing doubting students back in line.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855MYF class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“It was shifting the responsibility for the consequences of Sogyal’s actions onto the students,” one former student says. “To turn your back on the guru is the worst thing you can do.

He had spent his whole life, he wrote, “trying my best” to serve the Buddha’s teachings, “and not a day goes by when I am not thinking about the welfare of my students.” But in light of the controversy, and following the advice from his own masters about the obstacles arising for his health and life in general, he now intended to enter into retreat “as soon as possible”.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855Tt class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>He would also, he went on, “pray and practice for healing and understanding to prevail, and in the spirit of the great [...] masters of the past, take the suffering upon myself and give happiness and love to others.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855rBH class="c9 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Through all the years of rumours and revelations about Sogyal’s behaviour, one group maintained a conspicu­ous silence.

Sogyal is an abuser, he’s delusional, and he has created real, deep harm for people, and that’s not right in any place at all.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855AK class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“It’s like the Buddha said,” Goldman says, “everybody wants to be happy in life. So you join an organisation; you feel good, people are nice, you start to participate more; you invest a lot of time, perhaps a lot of money. At some point it becomes interwoven into your psyche. It’s a part of who you are. And to give that up is incredibly difficult and painful. I saw [Sogyal] as a friend, and on some level I still admire him as an accom­plished teacher; but he’s lost his way, and it’s very sad.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855pEG class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“Right now, I’m very unhappy. There’s a hole in my heart. But a lot of people just can’t give it up; they’re tied to him; they’d be giving up an authority figure, probably a father figure; psychologically, it would be a huge loss.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855uSF class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>In July, as the furore over the damning letter from the eight students grew, stories circulated on Buddhist sites of the incident in 2016 when the nun, Ane Chökyi, was punched in the stomach. In response, Chökyi posted a reply on a closed Facebook page, saying that Sogyal’s teachings at the retreat had been “loving beyond any ordinary description” and the punch to the stomach was “taken out of a greater context”.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855nIC class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“I have agreed to the skilful means of my master to purify and transform my delusions into clarity and uproot my attach­ments,” she wrote. “Sometimes these means can be wrathful and not always a pleasant experience, but that is what I need to be able to see through all the layers of ignorance that keep me blinded and stuck.” Sogyal, she went on, “was definitely not in a fit of rage, there was just a single moment of wrath, which manifested in a soft punch, but it was neither violent or abusive, at least not to my feelings.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U1015769278551UC class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Drolma posted a reply. She could understand Chökyi’s perspective completely, she wrote, because that was how she had once justified Sogyal’s behaviour to herself.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855tqD class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“If the student getting this kind of ‘special training’ has a history of abuse in other relationships in their life (as seems to be the case [for] many of us, including myself), then it is so much more natural, even comforting to receive wrathful attention from someone who is also telling us they love us deeply.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U1015769278550dB class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>But then, she wrote, “just like the flick of a switch, I recog­nised that ‘this is abuse’. And with that, I started to reflect on all the ways in which I had allowed it to happen.</p><p datatype="p" id=U1015769278559V class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“It was like in The Wizard of Oz, when the curtain is finally pulled back and you realise there is no ‘all-mighty Oz’, there is just a little man shouting into a microphone ...”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101576927855TGE class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Telegraph Magazine</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOpaann12nsqKw0miYq6yZmLmme5FqaGxwZ2x8o8HDnZ%2Biq52oeqOtw2aZqLFdm66tuIyspqCxkaF6s7XNqaacoJU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeremihs-net-worth-updated-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeremih's Net Worth (Updated 2023)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./agt-all-stars-bello-sisters-have-performing-in-their-blood-as-their-dad-was-in-cirque-du-soleil.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>AGT All Stars Bello Sisters have performing in their blood as their dad was in Cirque du Soleil</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
