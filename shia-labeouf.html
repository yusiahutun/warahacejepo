Shia LaBeouf is mostly popular for his role in the Disney show “Even Stevens”, ” Project Greenlight”, “Lawless”, and “The Transformers” franchise among others.</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Shia LaBeouf’s full name is Shia Saide LaBeouf and he was born on <strong>11 June 1986</strong>. He is currently <strong>37 years old</strong> and his zodiac is Gemini. He is originally from Los Angeles, California, U.S., and grew up in the neighborhood of Echo Park. Moreover, he grew up in a decidedly colorful family of mixed ethnicity. Further, his parents are his mother Shayna (née Saide), and his father Jeffrey Craig LaBeouf. He is the only child of his parents.</p><p>His mother is a dancer and ballerina turned visual artist and clothing jewelry designer. Similarly, his father is a Vietnam War veteran who had numerous jobs as a circus clown, a snow cone salesman, and a stand-up comic. His mother is Jewish whereas his father is a Christian of Cajun French descent.</p><p>He also describes himself as Jewish and he stated that he grew up around “both sides”. Moreover, he had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony and was also baptized in the Angelus church. He also attended one of the Christian camps and his first name is derived from Czaja, the Polish version of the Hebrew Yeshayahu (Isaiah), meaning “God is salvation.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-32917 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Shia-LaBeouf-past-and-present-photo.jpg alt="Shia LaBeouf" width=650 height=481 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-32917 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Shia LaBeouf’s past and present photos. He was a part of “Even Stevens” in the left photo. Source: E! News</p><h4>More about his family</h4><p>Similarly, he also described his parents as “hippies”. He describes his father as “tough as nails and a different breed of man” and his upbringing as similar to a “hippy lifestyle”. He stated that his parents were “pretty weird people, but they loved me and I loved them.”</p><p>During his childhood, he accompanied his father to meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. He has also said he was subjected to verbal and mental abuse by his father, who once pointed a gun at his son during a Vietnam War flashback. He has stated that, during his childhood, his father was on drugs and was placed in drug rehabilitation for heroin addiction, while his mother was trying to hold down the fort.</p><p>Unfortunately, his parents eventually divorced, mainly owing to financial problems. Moreover, he had what he described as a good childhood, growing up poor in Echo Park with his mother, who worked selling fabrics and brooches. His uncle was going to adopt him at one stage because his parents could not afford to have him anymore and “they had too much pride to go on welfare or food stamps.”</p><p>As a way of dealing with his parent’s divorce, he would perform for his family, mimicking his father. He remains close to and financially supports both of his parents. In an interview, he said that looking back on his childhood, he feels grateful and considers some of those memories as scars.</p><h2><span id=Education>Education</span></h2><p>Talking about his educational journey, he attended 32nd Street Visual and Performing Arts Magnet in Los Angeles (LAUSD) and Alexander Hamilton High School. However, he received most of his education from his tutors. Then he went on to receive higher education at Pierce College.</p><h2><span id=Career_and_Professional_Life>Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>Shia LaBeouf is an admirable and contemporary actor and director hailing from America. Similarly, he is also a performance artist and filmmaker.</p><p>During his preteen years, he decided to launch himself as an actor. Some stories abound concerning how far he carried his drive to establish himself. According to People Weekly magazine, he auditioned for Even Stevens and subsequently told each of the youngsters waiting to audition that he had the part. This eliminated the competition.</p><p><i>Even Stevens </i>is a Disney Channel series that delivered him into the spotlight. Such determination, along with raw ability and charisma, doubtless helped propel him straight to the head of Hollywood’s young stars.</p><h4>Beginning of the Career</h4><p>He used a phone book to find an agent and then honed a stand-up comedy act over two years. Also, he delivered “blue” routines to adult audiences at the young age of 12. He did so at a Pasadena comedy club, The Ice House. By his admission, he was booted out of every school he attended for his notoriously profane mouth and other reasons. However, he more than compensated for this with his professional drive.</p><p>The sitcom, Even Stevens, concerned the relationship between Louis Stevens, played by him, a silly and goofy teen, and his older sister, Ren, played by Christy Carlson Romano. This program quickly found an audience on Disney and lasted for several seasons. Its popularity spawned a small-screen feature, The Even Stevens Movie, in the year 2003.</p><p>The period from 2002 to 2003 was a busy one for him. It is also arguably his breakthrough period. In addition to The Even Stevens Movie, he also signed on to participate in season two of the controversial Project Greenlight. It is created by Damon and Affleck and it is a national contest for aspiring indie filmmakers. Project Greenlight has its HBO reality series of the same name.</p><p>Hence, the at-home viewers had the opportunity to watch The Battle of Shaker Heights months before that film’s release. It is a quirky comedy-drama produced by Efram Potelle and Kyle Rankin featuring, Elden Hensen, Kathleen Quinlan, Amy Smart, and other actors.</p><p>That same year, he starred in Holes. It is a Disney fantasy directed by Andrew Davis. Its success spurred him on to even greater heights. Further, his dramatic ability was honed even more sharply by his interaction with co-star Jon Voight, whom he would later list as a key professional influence.</p><h4>2004 Onwards</h4><p>In late 2004, he signed on for the lead in another Disney film, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Greatest Game Ever Played</a>. It is a biopic of golfer Francis Ouimet directed by Bill Paxton. The film itself divided critics rather sharply but provided an outstanding showcase for his talents.</p><p>The next several years found he signed on for several of the most sought-after A-list roles in Hollywood. It ranged from director Francis Lawrence’s apocalyptic fantasy Constantine as the demon-slayer fighting alongside Keanu Reeves in 2005 to Dito Montiel’s A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints&nbsp;as a young man struggling to find a different road out of the ghetto than crime and prison.</p><p>Then in 2007, he voiced a surfing penguin in the CG-animated comedy Surf’s Up and geared up for his role as Sam Witwicky in one of the most hotly anticipated releases of the year, Transformers, directed by Michael Bay. It is based on the action figures that were rabidly popular in the mid-’80s.</p><p>At the same time, he starred in director D.J. Caruso’s thriller Disturbia. This movie is the tale of a deeply depressed, homebound teen who teams up with a local girl to prove that their next-door neighbor is a much sought-after serial killer.</p><h4>More Involvements</h4><p>He continued to ride his popularity surge in the realm of latter-day sequels, playing Harrison Ford’s sidekick in 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. His character is a young financial exec Jake Moore in 2010’s Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.</p><p>Neither film was well-received by audiences or critics, but he still had the <i>Transformer</i>&nbsp;franchise in his pocket, and he’d continue with it for 2009’s Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and 2011’s Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Then, in the year 2012, he tried his hand at a period piece with the bootlegging drama Lawless.</p><p>Moreover, in the 2019 movie Honey Boy, he played the character James Lord and was also involved in this movie as a writer. In 2014, he appeared in Fury, Man Down&nbsp;in 2015, American Honey&nbsp;in 2016, and Borg vs. McEnroe in 2017. He also starred in&nbsp;The Peanut Butter Falcon as Tyler.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-32916 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Shia-LaBeouf-with-director-of-Honey-Boy.jpg alt="Shia LaBeouf " width=650 height=639 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-32916 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Shia LaBeouf was photographed with the director of “Honey Boy”, Alma Harel, for which Shia worked as an actor as well as a writer.

On 10 October 2016, the lovers married in a Las Vegas ceremony officiated by an Elvis impersonator. However, two days later, a source revealed that the pair performed a commitment ceremony instead of legal marriage.</p><p>Later that month, he confirmed their nuptials on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. However, in September 2018, the couple separated and filed for divorce.</p><p>Aside from Mia Goth, he has been in relationships with FKA Twigs from 2018 to 2019, Sasha Lane from 2015 to 2016, Karolyn Pho from 2010 to 2012, Carey Mulligan from 2009 to 2010, China Brezner from 2004 to 2007, and Hilary Duff in 2002.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-32920 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Shia-LaBeouf-with-ex-wife-Mia-Goth.jpg alt="Shia LaBeouf " width=650 height=341 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-32920 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Shia LaBeouf with his ex-wife Mia Goth at an event. Source: Refinery29</p><h2><span id=Legal_Troubles>Legal Troubles</span></h2><p>In the year 2005, Shia was arrested in Los Angeles after an altercation with his neighbor. He had threatened his neighbor with a kitchen knife. Two years after this incident, he was again arrested when he refused to leave a Chicago ‘Walgreens’ after a security guard asked him to leave. He received an arrest warrant when he failed to make a court appearance. They dismissed the charge later and he ended up paying a $500 fine.</p><p>Again in 2008, he was involved in a car crash after driving under the influence of alcohol. They suspended his driver’s license for a year. Following the accident, he had to go through several surgeries on his hand. Then in 2011, he was once again involved in an altercation with a commoner at a bar in Los Angeles. For this, the Los Angeles Police Department questioned him.</p><h4>More legal issues</h4><p>Additionally, on 26 June 2014, he was charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespass at New York City’s Studio 54 theater. He was reportedly “acting disorderly, yelling and being loud”. Since he refused to leave the theater, the police were called. In the arrest report, they stated that he swore and spat at arresting officers. They arrested and held him at the Midtown North police station to later appear in court.</p><p>Following the incident, he voluntarily began seeking outpatient treatment for alcoholism and was involved in a 12-step program. Again on 8 July 2017, at around 4 a.m., police arrested him in downtown Savannah, Georgia for public drunkenness, disorderly conduct, as well as obstruction. They released the bodycam footage of his profane tirade against the arresting officers following his arrest.</p><p>Then in October 2017, he was found not guilty of public intoxication. However, he pleaded no contest to the charge of disorderly conduct. They sentenced him to probation for one year, including time served, and they also ordered him to pay a $1,000 fine. The court further ordered him to get therapy to manage his anger and substance use issues. He later disclosed that he was diagnosed with PTSD during a stint in drug rehabilitation following the arrest.</p><h2><span id=Religion>Religion</span></h2><p>In 2004, Shia LaBeouf contributed an essay to the book I Am Jewish. The writer of this book is Judea Pearl. In the book, he stated that he has a “personal relationship with God that happens to work within the confines of Judaism”. He described himself as Jewish but later he declared in 2007 that religion had “never made sense” to him.</p><p>However, in an interview published in Interview magazine in October 2014, he stated “I found God doing Fury. I became a Christian man, and not in a fucking bullshit way – in a very real way. I could have just said the prayers that were on the page. But it was a real thing that saved me”.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements>Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Talking about Shia LaBeouf’s body measurement stats, he stands tall at a <strong>height</strong> of 1.76 m or 5’9″ and weighs around 72 kg.
