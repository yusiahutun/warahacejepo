We’ve got a big week ahead, and <a href=#>the moon’s ingress into overzealous Aries</a> on April 17 is a perfect way to start. Inspiring and headstrong, we are equally as motivated as we are more likely to act on impulse, so be sure to harness this fiery moon wisely. After all, it’s only upward and onwards from here, and the moon’s conjunction with lucky Jupiter on April 19 is here to prove it. Bountiful and swirling with optimism, emotions feel larger than life under this momentous conjunction… and to think, it doesn’t end there!</p><p>On April 20, there will be <a href=#>a total solar eclipse in Aries</a>, kicking off the first eclipse season of the year. In addition to this, it’s also the first of an eclipse series that will take place via the Aries-Libra axis between now and January 12th, 2025. That being said, this week’s supercharged <a href=# id=auto-tag_solar-eclipse data-tag=solar-eclipse>solar eclipse</a> will serve as a prelude of what’s to come. What’s even more interesting about this is, the sun will be entering Taurus hours later, and making a square to <a href=#>Pluto in Aquarius</a>. Change is here—are you ready for it?</p><p>If your <span><a href=#>sun sign</a> and/or <a href=#>rising sign</a></span> happens to fall under any of these <a href=# id=auto-tag_zodiac-signs data-tag=zodiac-signs>zodiac signs</a>, here’s why the cosmos is on your side this week:</p><h2>These 3 Zodiac Signs Will Have the Best Week</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/aries2.jpg><p>It may be the last week of your birthday season, but nothing can get in the way of your main-character energy, Aries. There’s a beautiful new chapter ahead of you, and you’re getting a glimpse of what to expect in these next two years. To kick things off, the moon will enter your sign late in the evening on April 17, emphasizing personal matters, such as home, family and your living space. Luna will eventually join lucky Jupiter in your sign on April 19, which is both expansive and invigorating.</p><p>This could also be auspicious energy, as Jupiter is considered a Benefic planet in <a href=# id=auto-tag_astrology data-tag=astrology>astrology</a>. So, if your faith has been tested recently, this is an opportunity to reconnect with your passions, and personal power. The first eclipse of the year has your name on it, and it’s a total solar eclipse at that! This celestial phenomenon is a catalyst for change, and new beginnings. And though manifesting isn’t necessarily suggested during eclipses, it doesn’t hurt to reflect on what you’re hoping to call in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/leo2.jpg><p>Reach for the stars, because you can do absolutely anything you put your mind to, <a href=# id=auto-tag_leo data-tag=leo>Leo</a>. If you’ve been doing your fair share of soul-searching, it’s likely due to Mars’ journey through Cancer and your 12th house of healing and unconscious patterns. Nevertheless, you could feel a strong pull to venture into the unknown, and this week’s astrology supports you along the way. For instance, after the moon enters Aries and your expansive ninth house of adventure, travel, wisdom and self-discovery, Luna will join forces with bountiful Jupiter—ruler of your celebratory fifth house of passion projects and self-expression—on April 19.</p><p>Have you considered exploring the potential of your talents and abilities? If you’re not taking a leap of faith towards the stage to perform, then you could be falling in love with a once-in-a-lifetime experience. There will be a total solar eclipse in this area of your chart the following day, ushering in significant changes in the next six months. Open your heart to what the future holds, and remain true to your authenticity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sag2.jpg><p>A beautiful heart-chakra activation is taking place this week, so don’t be afraid to let yourself crack open. Whether it be via a significant partnership or a joint business venture, you’re being encouraged to pursue your heart’s desires. For instance, the moon will be transiting through your fifth house of love, passion, and pleasure as of April 17. It will eventually join your planetary ruler, Jupiter, in hopeful conjunction overflowing with blessings and optimism.</p><p>Fertility is inevitable but it doesn’t have to involve baby making, unless you’re consciously working towards this. This week’s total solar eclipse will touch down on this area of your chart, which means the energy is building momentum, as it will bring forth powerful changes in the next six months. A new beginning awaits.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9mom6KZk2R%2BdIKWaW1tZ6qksaqtwmaqop%2BeqHqjsdKtZLCdlaB6orzRoqNmaWdif3F%2Bkmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./american-musician-james-hetfield-s-longtime-married-relationship-with-wife-francesca-hetfield.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>American Musician James Hetfield's Longtime Married Relationship With Wife Francesca Hetfield</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kodak-black-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kodak Black Parents, Arrested, Siblings, Net Worth, Height, Weight, Age</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
