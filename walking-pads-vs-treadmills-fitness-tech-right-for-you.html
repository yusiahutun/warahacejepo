For such a simple workout, it has some incredible benefits, such as lowering stress levels, boosting your mood, and improving sleep.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, when you can't visit the great outdoors to go for a walk, walking indoors is an awesome option, especially since you can control the conditions and environment and monitor your progress. But if you want to walk indoors, you have to use the correct exercise equipment. Two of the best pieces of indoor walking tech are walking pads and treadmills, so which one is right for you?</p><h2 id=indoor-walking-pads>Indoor Walking Pads</h2><p>Walking pads are a pretty new entry to the world of fitness tech, but they've gained popularity because of their size, price, and portability. Below are the various features of a walking pad and whether this device is suitable for you.</p><h3 id=walking-pads-are-affordable>1. Walking Pads Are Affordable</h3><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the main reasons walking pads have become so sought-after is their affordability. Their price makes them accessible to just about everyone. In fact, you can get a basic walking pad on Amazon for less than $200.</p><p>On the other hand, you can get a more high-quality machine, such as those from WalkingPad, for about $500, which is still a bargain compared to other fitness tech.</p><h3 id=a-walking-pad-conserves-space>2. A Walking Pad Conserves Space</h3><p>At-home workouts are easy and convenient, but fitting a regular treadmill into your living space is not always possible. If you want to get your steps in for the day and save room at the same time, walking pads are small, slim exercise machines that'll work perfectly for you.</p><p>They're ideal for you if you want to <a href=#>work out in a small living space</a>, such as an apartment or hotel room.</p><h3 id=walking-pads-are-easily-stored>3. Walking Pads Are Easily Stored</h3><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A space-saving exercise machine needs to be easily stored too! And fortunately, the majority of walking pads can be conveniently folded and stored under your bed, in your cupboard, or beneath your desk.</p><p>The WalkingPad X21 is the ultimate storable walking pad, as it offers innovative double-fold technology, so you can fold it in half twice and even store it upright.</p><h3 id=under-desk-exercise>4. Under-Desk Exercise</h3><p>Most walking pads can fit snugly under your desk, which means you can exercise and <a href=#>stay active while you're working</a> or studying. Not only does this mean that you can stay productive while exercising, but it also means your body can reap the benefits.</p><p>Sitting for long hours can be bad for your health, and it can strain your back and neck muscles, so a walking pad provides you with a way to fit in some physical activity during your work day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=walking-pads-have-limited-features>5. Walking Pads Have Limited Features</h3><p>Although walking pads often have a basic display to show your time, speed, steps, and calories—kind of like <a href=#>using a pedometer app</a>—that's where most of their features end.</p><p>Unlike a treadmill, walking pads cannot monitor metrics like your heart rate, and you have to use a companion app to access any preset workout programs or your workout data.</p><h3 id=walking-pads-are-only-for-walking>6. Walking Pads Are Only for Walking</h3><p>If you want to use a walking pad for running it'll likely have to have a handrail and come at a more expensive price point. For instance, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2-in-1 Folding Walking Pad from Costway</a> offers a running speed of up to 10.5 MPH but costs over $600.</p><p>Alternatively, you can purchase a cheaper machine from Costway, but they're not designed for high-impact running at a fast speed and only offer speed levels up to 4 MPH.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=treadmills>Treadmills</h2><p>Treadmills are tried-and-true exercise machines that make it easy to <a href=#>stay fit while working from home</a>. They also give you the freedom to <a href=#>control and track your workout sessions</a> and offer various smart features.</p><h3 id=treadmills-offer-a-variety-of-features>1. Treadmills Offer a Variety of Features</h3><p>While walking pads offer only the bare minimum features, treadmills—even basic, budget-friendly treadmills—offer a range of functions. A smart treadmill such as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Peloton Tread</a> provides auto-incline, heart rate monitoring, and even the ability to track your fitness journey.</p><p>What's more, when you use a treadmill you'll have better shock absorption and multiple incline and decline options.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=you-can-run-on-most-treadmills>2. You Can Run on Most Treadmills</h3><p>As previously mentioned, treadmills give you the freedom to run at higher speeds because most have a powerful motor for high-intensity running exercise sessions. Moreover, they're fairly stable exercise machines, so you don't have to worry about shaking while you move.</p><p>Running on a treadmill is a lot like running outdoors, but the great thing is that you have more control over your environment. Plus, most regular treadmills have longer and wider running belts which allows for safe and comfortable running.</p><h3 id=smart-features-of-treadmills>3. Smart Features of Treadmills</h3><p>From on-screen metrics to streaming workouts, treadmills such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bowflex Treadmills</a> provide a selection of impressive smart features. If you choose the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Treadmill 56 from Bowflex</a>, for example, you'll get an HD touchscreen where you can access workouts and coaching or stream your favorite shows or music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keep in mind that not all treadmills have smart features. However, if you're buying a treadmill it is quite an investment, so it's recommended that you get one with the best features as you likely won't be replacing it anytime soon.</p><h3 id=big-and-bulky-design>4. Big and Bulky Design</h3><p>A treadmill already takes up a lot of space, but most people forget that you also need a few feet of open room around your treadmill, too. In addition, treadmills are heavy and difficult to move.</p><p>Because they're tough to budge, you'll likely need a dedicated area for a treadmill unless you don't mind it being out in the open the whole time or squeezing it into a spare room.</p><h3 id=reliability-and-convenience>5. Reliability and Convenience</h3><p>Treadmills might be big, expensive machines, but that is why you can rely on them. Speaking about walking pads, because of their compact size and lightweight nature some can be flimsy and unstable to use.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Furthermore, a treadmill is an excellent choice if you rarely have any free time, can't leave the house to go to the gym, or running outdoors isn't an option. So come rain or shine, you can always jump on your handy treadmill to get a quick workout in.</p><h3 id=many-treadmills-are-expensive>6. Many Treadmills Are Expensive</h3><p>Sure, when you buy a treadmill, chances are that you will keep it for a long time, but treadmills are still incredibly costly. These machines are usually so pricey because of their advanced technology, weight and power capacities, and high-quality motors.</p><p>If you do opt for a cheaper treadmill, you won't get the same features or performance as a more expensive one. For example, one of the most expensive treadmills available is the elite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NordicTrack X32i Incline Trainer</a>, which costs around $6,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-do-walking-pads-and-treadmills-compare>How Do Walking Pads and Treadmills Compare?</h2><p>Although both these exercise machines give you a way to exercise indoors from the comfort of your own home, they have their differences. That being said, which one is better suited for you?</p><p>Walking pads are an excellent option if you're looking for a light, low-impact walking machine that you can grab during your day and use while you're busy. Otherwise, a treadmill is best if you'd prefer a more vigorous workout, and you have space to spare.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiumqSbnruoec%2Bam6xlpqh6tb7EmpumoZyhwG6yyK2lnqujYsGmr8dmqaKfmKl6p7vRZrCorV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-kelsey-dalition-details-to-know-about-the-wife-of-pro-golfer-cameron-young.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Kelsey Dalition?
