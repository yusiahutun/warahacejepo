"I would never leave my baby and my wife. I would die first before I leave them on the side of the road."</p><p>"They were at the hotel and that's what she considered stranded," he continued. "But look, she's right, I'm not even going to defend it. Baby, I was wrong. You were right."</p><p>According to Ray J, the reason for the fight with his wife was about Princess wanting to stay living in Los Angeles, while Ray J wanted to move to Las Vegas.</p><p>"I'm done with Vegas. I hate Vegas. Never again," he joked. He then grew more serious and added, "Princess made it pretty much clear enough, so at the end of the day, I've got to compromise. I have to do better as a husband. I've got to do better. I've got to do better and I have to understand my wife is pregnant and I have to think a little more wiser when I'm making decisions."</p><p>Williams then asked if Ray J and Princess are in an "open" marriage.</p><p>"Oh no. It would never be like that," he replied. "I would never get married if it wasn't super locked between us. I think what we gotta work on is keeping your circle tight. Me, her and our baby."</p><p>However, Williams didn't let Ray J off the hook yet and asked why the tech mogul was <a href=#><strong>photographed without his wedding band</strong></a>, which he was wearing at the daytime talk show.</p><p>"My hands was ashy and I needed to put some lotion on, so when I get up to the gate, I don't have no lotion," Ray J said about the photos. "I'm looking for the lotion, right there, boom, they got the picture."</p><p>"Any excuse is better than none," Williams replied.</p><p>Ray J and Princess Love got married in August 2016, and welcomed Melody Love Norwood in May 2018. Their relationship has had its ups and downs, which was well documented on VH1's "Love & Hip Hop."</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
