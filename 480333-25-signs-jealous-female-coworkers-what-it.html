This means you must always stand on guard because you are the only one who can look after your interest.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>When to leave a relationship: 15 signs you should give up on him</span></p></a><h2>Signs of jealous female coworkers and what to do about It</h2><p class=align-left>There are many signs of a jealous colleague, but the magnitude can vary. For instance, jealousy may spark healthy competition in the workplace or make the jealous individual contemplate harming or killing you. The signs of a jealous female coworker that you shouldn’t miss include:</p><h3>1. They will avoid you and the areas you frequent</h3><p class=align-left>The only reason why a person will avoid coming face to face with you is that that person cannot stand to see you let alone be near you. In this case, a jealous female coworker will go out of her way to avoid contact with you. You may notice that you no longer see her as often as you used to because you can’t find her even in common areas like the lunch room.</p><p class=align-left>What can you do about it? You have two choices to deal with a jealous female coworker who is avoiding you. The first is to also avoid her as long as it does not affect the work you are tasked to do. Alternatively, you can confront her to find out why she is avoiding you in order to resolve the situation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e974b1ad64e30313.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why do guys stare but never approach me?</span></p></a><h3>2. Avoiding eye contact with you at all times</h3><p class=align-left>When a person avoids eye contact with you, it is because she has something to feel guilty about. This is also a sign that she has no respect for you. Therefore, she will ignore your presence in a room as if you are not there. Avoiding eye contact can also be associated with anger, jealousy, and dislike. This can make life difficult for you and her.</p><p class=align-left>Try to remember whether you did anything to justify this treatment. If there is, then deal with it. For instance, you might have been promoted to a position she was expecting. Let her know you understand her feelings and that her reaction is uncalled for.</p><h3>3. Exhibiting negative body language around you</h3><p class=align-left>If a coworker is jealous, it will be difficult for her to resist the temptation of being hostile towards you. To express her feelings, she will send overt messages through her body language. For example, she may do things like rolling her eyes, staring at you, refusing to smile or even not returning your greetings.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You may feel embarrassed because of the treatment hence the need to get to the bottom of it. Try to be nice to her and inquire why she is treating you that way. Diplomacy may not work but assure her you have no ill motive towards her.</p><h3>4. Openly criticizing you</h3><p class=align-left>When a person wants to criticize to help you improve, they will do it privately. However, if they do it openly, it is because their mission is to embarrass you. These criticisms may extend beyond the workplace into your private choices. She will condemn your dressing preference or even your sexuality.</p><p class=align-left>What can you do? You must always separate legitimate critiques from petty put-downs and take the necessary action. In such a case, it can be considered a form of harassment, and you can notify your supervisor about it.</p><h3>5. Offering only backhanded compliments</h3><p class=align-left>This is what we call passive-aggressiveness, which you may not notice if you are not careful. In this case, your female colleague will only offer you insincere and backhanded compliments. They will use every opportunity to diminish your achievements by bringing up your past failures.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>8 ways to win a girl who rejected you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They may even claim that they are the reason for your success or that you were given an unfair advantage. This borders next to character assassination; hence you can initiate disciplinary or legal proceedings.</p><h3>6. Never inviting you to join them</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg><p class=align-left>All the other colleagues at work will be invited to join her, but you will find yourself isolated. She will exclude you from things like coffee conversations or other informal meetings. She will do all she can to limit your interactions. When other colleagues ask, she will make up excuses about your absence.</p><p class=align-left>What can you do? In this case, you have to confront her because if you don’t, the next time, she might not invite you to a formal meeting, and it might get you into trouble.</p><h3>7. Celebrating your mistakes</h3><p class=align-left>A jealous female coworker will be happy to see your downfall. They will be quick to celebrate whenever you have made a mistake. They will light up in your challenging moments because they want you to fail.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/37680e627e1181e2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to reject a girl politely without hurting her feelings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They then embark on a mission to show you that you are not as great as your achievement. Learn from your mistakes and do it right the next time to prove them wrong. Always focus on improving yourself.</p><h3>8. Mocking any honours or recognition you receive</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the most common signs of jealous female colleagues. They tend to resolve into mocking or trivializing any awards, honours, or recognitions you may receive.</p><p class=align-left>They will be quick to offer you a modicum of praise but shroud it in sarcasm or passive-aggressive messages. Do not engage the person by mocking her back because it will only soil your reputation. Just ignore her and focus on your goals.</p><h3>9. Always remarking that you unfairly have the better job</h3><p class=align-left>A jealous person will never accept that you have achieved anything on merit. She will always see herself in endless competition with you. In her mind, <a href=# title>every opportunity</a> should be used to prove that she is better than you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5aa879800d66801e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 biggest pet peeves in relationships that will drive you crazy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She will always try to surpass you in everything you do to justify her sentiments that you have an unfair advantage. Do not divert your attention to unhealthy competition because it will make you lose focus of your duties.</p><h3>10. Refusing to devote time towards assisting you</h3><p class=align-left>Everybody needs the help of coworkers from time to time. However, sometimes this team effort may be lacking when one of your coworkers lacks time to offer assistance to you. Every time you need her to assist you, she will say that she is busy even when you know she is not.</p><p class=align-left>You will go out of your way to assist her when it is her turn, but she will never reciprocate. You can give her a dose of her own medicine by refusing to assist her as well, or you stand on the moral high ground and continue doing good without asking for anything in return.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhsh3j06p7a3g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>6 tips on how to get over someone you like fast</span></p></a><h3>11. Devaluing your work</h3><p class=align-left>If you are assigned roles that devalue or de-emphasize your contributions to the success of the organization, it is a sign of jealousy. Such a coworker will assign you to the most underrated or despised team. All your ideas will be discarded or implemented without giving credit to you.</p><p class=align-left>In such a situation, your hands may be tied if the person is your superior, but you can seek redress from their supervisor. If nothing changes, you should consider leaving the organization.</p><h3>12. Acting in a resentful manner towards you</h3><p class=align-left>A jealous person will find it difficult to hide her resentment towards you. She will talk ill of you behind your back and create intense tension between you and other coworkers.</p><p class=align-left>In the end, the toxic nature of her resentment will become a workplace distraction. You can either confront them or ignore them. In the case of the former, you should remain calm and be logical rather than emotional.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs7d0glvdgd5a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Expert Tips On How to Approach a Girl in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>13. Changing facial expressions in your presence</h3><p class=align-left>When she cannot avoid you, your coworker will ensure that you notice her mood change when you are around. They will suddenly change their facial expressions from happy to sulky mood. This is a signal that you are not welcome and that your contribution is not valued. This will create tension and negativity in the workplace.</p><p class=align-left>If the expressions are not getting to your head, you can ignore them. However, if they lead to tension that affects your productivity, you can seek a transfer to another department where you do not come face-to-face with the individual.</p><h3>14. She talks with other colleagues in your absence, but once you appear, she shuts up or changes the topic</h3><p class=align-left>You’ve probably found yourself in a situation where you enter a noisy room, and all of a sudden, everybody falls silent. This is an obvious sign that they were up to no good and were probably talking about you.</p><p class=align-left>The explanation for that is that one or more people in the room are jealous of your accomplishments. Build trust with other coworkers so that they do not participate in negative conversations about you.</p><h3>15. She complains about your office space</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e974b1ad64e30313.jpg><p class=align-left>Jealousy will make your coworker complain about all manner of trivial things. For example, she may say that your desk is blocking the way or her view of the window. Sometimes she may say that your <a href=#>office space</a> is unfairly larger than hers. Your space may be bigger but justified because your input in the company is more valuable, but she will not consider that.</p><p class=align-left>You cannot give up your workspace because it is assigned to you to facilitate your roles. Therefore, you should ignore her or try to explain to her why you have different office spaces.</p><h3>16. Always disagreeing with you</h3><p class=align-left>Your envious colleague will not bring herself to accept that anything coming from you can be valuable. She will play down all your ideas as not good enough, even when she knows you are right.</p><p class=align-left>She may come up with excuses like you did not conduct enough research or you failed to provide proof to back up your claim. Always come up with foolproof ideas and do your homework thoroughly before presenting them to counter her with proof whenever she challenges you.</p><h3>17. Sabotaging your work</h3><p class=align-left>This is when a coworker engages in activities that disrupt your productivity so that you are unable to achieve the goals set for you. For example, they may plot to delete a project you have been working on for a long time. This is because, to them, your success is getting in the way of theirs.</p><p class=align-left>This is a matter that should be addressed immediately. You should seek an audience with your manager in order to find a solution.</p><h3>18. Keen attention to your flaws and failures</h3><p class=align-left>When something positive or an accomplishment you have made is shared, a jealous coworker will respond by calling attention to the flaws and failures associated with the situation. Even when they congratulate you, they will put emphasis on the negative aspects.</p><p class=align-left>She may remark that you will handle the pressure that comes with a promotion. Just focus on the positives and assure her that nothing will deter you from pursuing your goals.</p><h3>19. Turning down your invitation</h3><p class=align-left>You may have a function such as a<a href=#> birthday party </a>whereby you invite all your colleagues. Some may not come because of valid reasons, but a jealous coworker will turn down the invitation without explaining.</p><p class=align-left>To her, workplace competition has turned you into an enemy to be avoided at all times. Since you’ve not been in any conflict with the person, there is nothing you can do to change her mind. Just stop inviting her to your functions.</p><h3>20. Never asks about your personal life</h3><p class=align-left>Employees normally care about the well-being of their colleagues, even outside of the workplace. They often enquire about life and how other <a href=#>family</a> members are doing. They will be quick to offer their support whenever you need them.</p><p class=align-left>A jealous coworker will never ask about your personal life because it does not concern them. This is among the obvious signs a female coworker doesn’t like you. Ask about her personal life without minding if she cares about yours or not.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg><h3>21. They encourage you to leave the company</h3><p class=align-left>This happens when your jealous coworker wants to eliminate the competition. She will encourage you to leave your <a href=#>current job</a> either because the company is not treating you well or to go and look for a promotion elsewhere.</p><p class=align-left>The real reason is that they no longer want you around due to their jealousy. Always do what you feel is right for you, and don’t allow other people to mislead you into making wrong decisions.</p><h3>22. They act defensively around you</h3><p class=align-left>A jealous person would not like to appear vulnerable around you. This makes them defensive whenever they are around you, and this is among the most common signs a coworker is competing with you.</p><p class=align-left>She will snap when you offer assistance and tell you that she is capable of handling her problems. All you can do is give such an individual space and avoid meddling in her affairs.</p><h3>23. She always comments about how your work is more exciting than hers</h3><p class=align-left>It is okay if a coworker says that you have a more exciting job once in a blue moon. However, if she constantly keeps bringing it up every time you meet, then it is because she is not comfortable with how things are.</p><p class=align-left>She is probably envious of your position and would do anything to get it. Just acknowledge what she is saying but watch out so that she does not plot to have you removed from the position.</p><h3>24. Ignores you when you speak to her</h3><p class=align-left>This is the rudest a jealous coworker can get. She will ignore you when you speak to her as if you do not exist. It does matter whether you are having a conversation with the entire team or with her alone. She will go on with her duties and pretend that she did not hear you.</p><p class=align-left>Others will go as far as letting you know they don’t want you to talk to them. This is a situation in which your hands are tied because you cannot force a person to listen to you. Ask to be assigned to a different team or department to avoid interacting with the individual in future.</p><h3>25. They stalk you</h3><p class=align-left>A jealous coworker wants to know your every move so as to document your downfalls and weaknesses. You will notice that they are inquiring about you even in matters that do not concern them. They may even stalk you outside your work area.</p><p class=align-left>Stalking means the person is probably invading your personal space as well as your privacy. If you deem it as a threat to you, the best thing to do is to get a restraining order.</p><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>world</a> can be a mean place, and if you are not careful, you will find yourself in a bad place after being betrayed by those you trust. You should always be critical of coworkers even when they are good to you because you don’t know their motivation. While many may have good intentions towards you, others will pretend to be your friends before they bring you down. Be safe and watch out for signs of jealous female coworkers if you don’t want any trouble at work.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke published an article on <a href=#>how to deal with a coworker</a> who is trying to get you fired. When you start working in a company or organization, you want to get along with everyone. Unfortunately, this isn't always possible.</p><p class=align-left>You might encounter one or several coworkers who don't like you and would do anything to get you out of that company. In such a case, if you really love that work environment and wish to remain an employee for many years to come, you must know how to deal with a coworker who is trying to get you fired.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCywJyrrGWcnrOmtMCcoqxnZG19dH%2BSZmluZaOetK%2B%2FjKOcmqSfqsBussSmmKWdXZi8uLvRpJyrq12staLAjKKraA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stream-kodi-chromecast.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Stream Kodi on a Chromecast</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-does-running-my-microwave-kill-my-wi-fi-connectivity.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Does Running My Microwave Kill My Wi-Fi Connectivity?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
