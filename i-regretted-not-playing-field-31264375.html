saying there's nothing shameful about what they are doing.</p><p>Kaye, 44, told Daily Star: “It has been amazing. We all say that age is just a number but I really feel that the person I am now is the person I should have always been. I’m here to prove there’s life after 44 and I feel like 40s is definitely the new 25.”</p><p>But the nurse may never have reached such a content state of mind had she kept her fears to herself.</p><p>She met Paul, also 44, at a kickboxing club and they have known each other for a long time – and last year they tied the knot having been together for a decade.</p><p>But prior to getting involved romantically with him, Kaye had been in another long-term relationship for 14 years, meaning she had never embraced the single life.</p><p>And it was that niggling thought at the back of her mind that made her initiate an open dialogue six years ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31192965.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_adult-star.jpg><p>Remembering it, she said: “I did feel quite nervous but we communicate about everything. I just thought you know what, I am going to ask and if it’s a no, it’s a no.</p><p>“To begin with it started off as a fantasy like the plumber is going to come and fix your pipes. We never really played the field when we were younger.</p><p>“So it started like that and Paul said he didn’t feel like he had missed out on life but a little bit later he came to me and said ‘maybe I did, what do you want to do’?”</p><p>They eventually signed up to a swinger’s website and it wasn’t until a year later when they actually had sex with other people.</p><p>It happened at a swinger club in London and the anxious pair were prepared just to go as bystanders – but things took a kinky turn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Opening up about the unforgettable night, Kaye said: “Oh we were absolutely crapping ourselves, so so nervous. We kept saying we are not going to do anything and we were just going to watch.</p><p>“But we were absolutely petrified, we had the butterflies in our stomachs and we walked into a club and there’s also this misconception that people think it’s going to be really a really seedy kind of club and you have this image of what swingers are going to look like but it’s nothing like that at all.</p><p>“They were all different ages, young, older, middle-aged and we went along and did a full couple swap on our first night. The next morning we had breakfast and I remember thinking, ‘oh my word, did we actually do that’.</p><p>“We are not particularly jealous people but you don’t know how you are going to feel so we thought that if it wasn’t right for us or it was going to affect our relationship or that if one of us didn’t like it then we would stop it – but we both thought it was absolutely amazing.”</p><p>Paul and Kaye, who now monetise their bedroom antics with an <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>OnlyFans</a> account, have attended sex clubs ever since and have made life-long friends along the way.</p><p>They also said it has enhanced their relationship by creating a stronger bond when they get back together after exploring their sexuality with others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31264315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/394562064_347281267705986_3302050663825006833_n.jpg><p>But they believe that embracing non-monogamy will not work for every couple – especially if the relationship is strained to begin with.</p><p>Kaye said: “Our sex life was fantastic and there was no issue with that but we felt like we were missing something. And if you feel the same way you just have to have the conversation and you have to be honest and transparent.</p><p>“But make sure you pick a good time, don’t wait until you are doing your food shop in Morrisons, sit down and have a good conversation.</p><p>“We have come across people who are in sex clubs and they have had arguments because they clearly shouldn’t be there.</p><p>“So make sure you set your boundaries, ours evolved over time but say to each other that it’s not about the other as a person, it’s about something you feel you need to explore, it might be a bisexual side you never experienced when you were younger and ask would they be happy coming along the journey with you.</p><p>“And make it clear that if it isn’t for you, you make clear that you both stop. We have heard of people where one partner didn’t like it and the other did and the relationship has gone to turmoil.</p><p>“So your relationship needs to be strong in the first place because as Paul says, it definitely won’t fix a broken relationship.”</p><p><b><i>Want all the biggest Lifestyle news straight to your inbox? <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Sign up for our free Daily Star Hot Topics newsletter</a>.</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKSfq7Juv8SxZqJlopq0s7HTrZydZZ6kwW68y5qwoqaXYrOqscudZGxpYmuBdIOU</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blackpinks-jennie-and-zico-are-a-cool-duo-in-new-teaser-photos-of-spot-ahead-of-singles-release-1299455.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BLACKPINKs Jennie and Zico are a cool duo in new teaser photos of SPOT ahead of single's release</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ravinia-festivals-war-of-the-lawn-spot-at-donna-summer-concert.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ravinia Festival's War Of The Lawn Spot At Donna Summer Concert</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
