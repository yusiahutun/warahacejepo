Some describe him as a controversial, racist arsonist, and his critics say he is a political activist who should be held responsible for the deterioration of racial relations.</p><p>To the black American population, however, he is a hero who is willing to go to prison for promoting their cause. Former US President Barrack Obama described him as “the voice of the voiceless and a champion of the oppressed”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Al Sharpton – Bio/Wiki</strong></h2><p>Al Sharpton was born on 3 October 1954 as Alfred Charles Sharpton Jr. in Brooklyn New York City. Sharpton attended public schools in Queens and Brooklyn. He graduated from Samuel J. Tilden High School in 1972 and was enrolled at Brooklyn College, where he was a major in contemporary politics before dropping out after two years. During his school years, he became involved in civil rights movements, held several leadership positions, and participated in several high-profile protests aimed at achieving equality between black and white Americans.</p><p>While dropping out of school, he founded his own organization, which was named the National Youth Movement. The organization’s activities helped to keep the media’s attention on the racially motivated murder of a black teenager named Michael Griffith in 1986.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Bailee Madison Bio, Age, Height, Feet, Dead or Alive</a></strong></p><p>As a child and a churchgoer ordained as a pastor at the age of 10, Sharpton developed his confident style of speech. He was best described as a socio-political activist and religious leader who became a leading fighter and a roaring voice in the fight against racial prejudice and injustice against Americans of black origin. In this struggle, he got into various problems and even survived an assassination attempt. But whatever problems he had, he remained true to his activism by organizing more protests and giving press conferences whenever and for whatever purpose they took place.</p><p>He fought at various times against being elected to several political offices but is not known to have been an elected official. On one of his unsuccessful political trips, he hinted that winning political office may not have been his ultimate goal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Al Sharpton Height/Weight</strong></h2><p>Before we talk about his size, you might think of the image of an obese Al Sharpton. Yeah, it’s the same person. He lost about 125 pounds in 2010 after a well-planned four-year weight loss routine. He attributed his dramatic weight loss to a change in diet and says that he does not eat meat, but fish twice a week and lots of fruit and vegetables.</p><p>Al Sharpton, a former advisor to former US President Barack Obama in the White House, has not disclosed his exact height. However, his social/political popularity is certainly greater than his height, because wherever he stands to speak, crowds gather to listen to him, as we know him more for who he is than for what he looks like.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Al Sharpton’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The preacher leads a comfortable and public active life. This is possible above all because the struggle for an egalitarian America has been fought and won with his contributions, which are not missing in the action. His net worth is estimated at 500,000 to 5 million dollars. In 2014, we learned that Al Sharpton and his many companies owed a total of $4.7 million in taxes. However, he successfully repaid more than $2 million of that debt.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Kristina Pimenova Parents, Wiki, Family, Net Worth, Age, Height</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Al Sharpton Wife, Girlfriend, and Daughter</strong></h2><p>Sharpton met his wife, the background singer Kathy Jordan, in 1971 on a tour with James Brown. The two of them tied the wedding cord in 1980 when their union enabled the birth of two daughters, Dominique and Ashley Sharpton. Al’s marriage to Kathy was not firmly rooted in the powerful agreement “until death shows us the way”. The preacher and his wife divorced amicably in 2004. It is common knowledge that while still married to Kathy, the socio-political activist had a girlfriend in the person of Aisha McShaw.</p><p>Sharpton and his newfound love were seen together at many public events and elegant brawls across the country. Well, it is official that the two are a couple. McShaw, as far as we know about her, described herself professionally as a personal stylist and personal banker.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51krq150qGYq6ikpLtursioZKedpGLEsL7ToWSwoZaaeqi10aWdq6GVo7FusMCunqGslad6uLXKomShnZmctbV7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bob-sagets-daughter-says-victim-nearly-1-year-full-house-stars-death-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bob Sagets Daughter Says Shes Not a Victim Nearly 1 Year After the Full House Star</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shemar-moore-first-child-jesiree-dizon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shemar Moore Welcomes First Child with Girlfriend Jesiree Dizon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
