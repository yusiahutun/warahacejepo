All I can do is wonder why I’m here and how I can get up and walk away.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Night is the worst time. As the silence approaches, I worry about this Tom Ray person.

I try to make sense of the situation by describing it aloud: ‘You are Nic and I am Tom, and I am so sorry I never married you.’ (In fact, we’d got married 18 months earlier and when I became ill Nic was nine months pregnant — not that I could remember this, either.)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘You’ve been ill, Tom. So, so ill,’ she tells me. ‘Am I dying?’ ‘No.’ She says no, with a tiny shake of her head, and I see her eyes fill with tears. ‘Say hello to your new son, Tom. He’s six weeks old.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>My daughter Grace is nearly three and I’d spent huge amounts of time with her since her birth, giving up my job to be a househusband and scriptwriter, while Nic ran our video production business. But since I became ill, I never see her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>My face is so badly disfigured, it’s too difficult for her to understand what has happened.

Soon, I come to realise that this little girl really needs me and I beg Nic to bring her. I think it’s then, when she replies, that I really start to take in the full extent of the tragedy we’re living through.</p><img id=i-4e5581ff9e2b2293 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/18/22/447435E200000578-0-image-m-11_1505771317893.jpg height=429 width=634 alt="Family ties: Tom'a partner, Nic, pictured with their daughter Grace - as their world's changed &nbsp;" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Family ties: Tom'a partner, Nic, pictured with their daughter Grace - as their world's changed &nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She’s too frightened, Tom. She wouldn’t want to see you . . . like this,’ Nic says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I haven’t been able to look in a mirror, avoiding it at first because it never occurs to me that there is anything wrong, and then because when I ask people to describe what they see, their own faces become screwed up, embarrassed. Occasionally, a new nurse appears in my hospital room to wash and dress me. They open the curtains, saying something chirpy, turn, and pull back my covers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I try not to look in their eyes, or hear their sharp intake of breath. So, in heartbreaking scenes, Grace is brought to hover outside my doorway, and we just call out to each other.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I long to hug her, to hold her. Until I can do this, I can’t be whole again, or be the person I am meant to be. But then, one afternoon after I’ve been in hospital for four months, Grace suddenly asks Nic: ‘Will I see my daddy today?’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>We think she is ready. The day she comes, her two grandmothers come, too. Nic asks them to wait outside first, to see if I am ready.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Grace breaks free and too late, she has reached the door of my room and slipped inside. I see her, and she sees me. Our eyes lock. Her mouth drops open.</p><img id=i-2de5d6497e271c31 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/18/22/447435EA00000578-0-image-m-13_1505771421203.jpg height=698 width=634 alt="Determined: Nic pictured at Tom's bedside in the hospital as he recovers from his ordeal" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Determined: Nic pictured at Tom's bedside in the hospital as he recovers from his ordeal</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nic has been trying to straighten my bedclothes, but she senses something is wrong as my body tenses and I scramble to sit up.

I try to smile, although the tightness of the amputated lower half of my face is exacerbated into a gormless, monstrous grimace.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For half a minute, the three of us are locked in some kind of standoff. Then Grace’s face reddens, and she screams at the top of her voice: ‘That’s not my daddy.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Grace turns and runs, her little feet pounding down the corridor. Nic runs after her, past alarmed visitors, nurses and doctors.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When she comes around the corner, in front of the sliding glass doors to the car park, Nic sees a group of people staring at a vending machine.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There seems to be something, or someone, trapped in the gap between it and the wall.

I am sedated, catheterised, intubated, haemofiltrated. A tracheotomy is performed on my neck, so that I can breathe. They have to stretch my mouth artificially, since it has closed up after they cut away my lips. A spring-like mechanism made out of tensed wire is inserted between my teeth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It’s like a metal trap that keeps my mouth wide open, for as long as I can stand, every day. Skin is scraped from the rest of my body, then re-applied to the space where my lips and chin used to be.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I am fed through a hole in my stomach. I am psychoanalysed, visited by all and sundry at various times of the day and night. I break down regularly and cry, both in company and when I am alone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Every day I want to die, and every day I want to live; then I want to die all over again. It’s exhausting — for me, and for everyone else.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I’ve met hundreds of medical staff during my long stay in hospital, but none has shown me so much respect as Mr Malata, a reconstructive plastic surgeon at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge (where I was transferred two months into my coma). ‘I’m not going to lie to you, Mr Ray. Rebuilding your face is going to be very, very challenging.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I look over to Nic. As ever, she is stoic, willing to believe the best.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m afraid, Mr Ray, you’ll never be quite the same man you were. But hopefully your appearance will be somewhat improved.’</p><img id=i-3a451e0f8245cdc4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/18/22/4474361600000578-0-image-m-17_1505771596331.jpg height=407 width=634 alt="Young love: Tom and Nic Ray pictured on their wedding day - unaware of what was to come" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Young love: Tom and Nic Ray pictured on their wedding day - unaware of what was to come</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nic looks at me.

Nic is a constant presence, always at my side, distracting me with the business of life whenever I get low.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I try my hardest to be strong, but even though I’m nearly 40, I’m scared witless in the operating theatre. As it transpires, there will be a series of extreme skin grafts to rebuild my mouth and nose.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This will involve a fat wad of pale skin from my belly, which will be split to form lips, and later a ghoulish graft from my shoulder.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These operations will take more than 12 hours. And later there will be revisions. The medical team advise that the best way to proceed is for me to remain conscious throughout the facial surgery. So I’m laid out flat with about 20 people around me, a floodlight illuminating my face.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The light is so bright I want to close my eyes, but my anxiety level is such that I keep on opening them again to check the danger.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Malata is nervous, I know that: he’s been honest with me, and has told me he’s never done anything like this before.
