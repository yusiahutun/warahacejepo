In Alaska, for example, seal’s blood, with its much-touted reinvigorating properties, is a popular treat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/08/06/d6b3754a-d56c-11ea-a9df-dfa023813e67_972x_073140.jpg><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Blood sausages</span></a> were first made in Europe thousands of years ago, with fresh, uncoagulated pig’s blood on the day of slaughter. Each country has its own variant. In France, they’re called boudin noir; in Spain, morcilla; England, black pudding; and Germany, blutwurst.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blood soups, curds and pancakes made with blood instead of milk, liqueurs and creams are also popular. The French keep the blood of game to make elaborate sauces such as salmis, used in sophisticated dishes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blood food recipes have been devised by many Michelin-starred chefs in Europe.

In villages where cooks preserve the recipes of their grandmothers, sanguinaccio is still made from fresh pig’s blood, salt, pepper, extra virgin olive oil, grated garlic and herbs.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sanguinaccio is thought to be a tonic for sick and anaemic people, women in labour and couples trying to have a baby. Italians have a saying: “Blood calls blood, it keeps the hormones up and the veins pumping.” Many things associated with blood also have a sexual connotation in Italy: if a woman makes a man “feel blood”, it means that she physically arouses him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Pigs have always been the primary source of food; you eat everything of the pig,” says Gianfranco Bonacci, an Italian cultural expert. “Before, every family kept and butchered pigs in their backyard.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My grandmother had one, and the slaughter was a feast.

Mixed with rice, cinnamon, pistachio and lemon peel, it was once used as cake filling or stuffed inside a pig’s gut to make a chocolate salami. The bloody and sweet dessert paste can still be savoured in isolated towns as a dip for biscuits.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9ofXqCj3JtaJ6fpLG0ecyam55lkqG8sLCMmqmorZ6Zeri70aWbZpyZqLWmv4yrnJyhoJrAbq3NnWSwoKlivaa7z6Wc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./interview-dolce-and-gabbana-courting-china-couture-and-those.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Interview: Dolce and Gabbana on courting China, couture and those controversial baby comments</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./boots-no7-advent-calendar-details.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Boots just dropped FOUR No7 advent calendars for 2023 heres all you need to know</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
