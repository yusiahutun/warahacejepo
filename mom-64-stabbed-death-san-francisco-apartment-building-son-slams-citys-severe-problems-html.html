stairwell.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The victim's family said they believe her attempts to hide meant others inside the building failed to find her, and she lay in hiding for roughly an hour, Lim reported on social media.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hu was eventually discovered unresponsive at approximately 11am, and she succumbed to her injuries soon after first responders arrived on the scene.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Esparza was booked into San Francisco County Jail on charges of murder, elder abuse, and resisting arrest.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>No motive has yet been released for the slaying, however staff and neighbors say Esparza suffered serious mental health issues and relied on the care of his mother, according to <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>MissionLocal</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His mother was reportedly not in the building at the time of the

serve as her mother's caretaker, which she had done for almost 10 years before her mother passed several months ago.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Neighbors inside the apartment block told <a
