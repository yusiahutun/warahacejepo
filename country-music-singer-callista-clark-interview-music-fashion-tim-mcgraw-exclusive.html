I had my first co-write in Nashville when I was 14 with two legendary writers, and I didn't know what a co-write was, I'd only written with myself and my mom before that.</p><p id=eZ8N2T2gb_VB0 data-wc=66><strong>"I was super scared and super intimidated because I didn't know what to write about – I didn't drink, I didn't drive</strong>, none of those things so I was like, 'What do we write a song about?'

Do you feel pressure to match their success?</h3><p id=e0LydBxri7jfJ data-wc=56>"I've honestly never felt like that. I've been working with Big Machine and my manager Scooter [Braun] since I was 13, and they've been super patient and super smart, and very encouraging through this whole experience with me. <strong>We're extremely close and everybody has been so supportive since my music came out and even before that.</strong></p><p id=e6QV8CrN-cxaU data-wc=33>"Honestly, I feel like everybody in country music is the same, they're all so humble and so genuine and everyone that I've gotten the chance to meet has been the exact same way."</p><h3>A lot of country songs are very personal, and many involve heartbreak, have you experienced your first heartbreak yet?</h3><p id=e4H_FyDKIX98t data-wc=71><strong>"I've definitely been through the relationship thing and the heartbreaks and being super heartbroken.</strong> It's actually pretty funny, some covers that I've done, you can see there's one that I posted where my hair is on the side of my head, I was wearing a T-shirt and there are tears on my sleeve - I looked like a wreck but I posted it anyway, so I've definitely felt all the things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/903d2965f492-callista-clark-performing-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eWGf9z1zSVlN1 data-wc=10><strong>Callista has already won herself an army of loyal fans</strong></p><p id=e0FfsPPHlz5a2 data-wc=65>"But inspiration can come from anything. With my single,, we kind of framed that [song] like it was written to one specific guy or a relationship but it really wasn't. It was just the overall feeling like you weren't listened to or weren't understood or weren't given the chance to show somebody who you are and what you're capable of doing."</p><h3>How are you coping with your growing fame?</h3><p id=eXTSs47BPw33W data-wc=52>"It can be intimidating at times and it's something you're constantly trying to figure out because it's different everywhere you go. But If I'm at the level where I'm 'famous' and people start to recognize me then I think that's a huge deal and I'm doing something right - it's really encouraging."</p><h3>Is there anyone in the music industry you really admire?</h3><p id=eBLifKWS7BdyM data-wc=45>"Jennifer Nettles - the lead singer of Sugarland. I met her once through a performing arts school I was in growing up - Georgia 4H Clovers and Company - she was the national spokesperson at the time, and she asked me to perform with her.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=eby243czuUt9a data-wc=15><strong>Callista's debut single made it into the country top 20 during its release in 2021</strong></p><p id=eL2kLl6cUkE8L data-wc=46>"I was 11 years old and she's one of my biggest influences.

But we'll just have to see. <strong>I would absolutely be down to sing with Tim McGraw."</strong></p><h3>With your fanbase growing and a lot of younger girls now looking up to you, do you feel responsible to be a role model to&nbsp;them?</h3><p id=eCCb6nMHcv1Ua data-wc=45>"For me, I'm a songwriter and I'm very particular about what I write about and what I say in my songs, and what I don't say.
