In this article, we’ll explore the features that set them apart when it comes to digital art, so that you can make an informed choice.</p><h2 id=can-the-ipad-double-as-a-drawing-tablet>Can the iPad Double as a Drawing Tablet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/person-holding-ipad-and-apple-pencil.jpg><p>The answer is yes. When the iPad was introduced in 2010, some people thought it was a “giant iPhone,” barely useful for more than browsing the internet, reading books, and playing games. But over the years, the iPad has evolved.</p><p>As it now supports input from keyboards and styluses, the range of its applications has increased. With the Apple Pencil, an iPad can easily be converted to a drawing tablet. This can be exciting news for creative professionals. But when it comes down to deciding between an iPad and a drawing tablet, which one makes the most sense?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That decision depends on a combination of factors. To help you decide which is a better choice, we have curated a comprehensive list in which we perform a comparative analysis of both devices.</p><h2 id=multifunctionality>1. Multifunctionality</h2><p>One of the primary distinctions between iPads and drawing tablets lies in their functionality.</p><p>iPads are versatile devices capable of multitasking, web browsing, gaming, and more. While you draw or paint on your iPad with your Apple Pencil, you can easily switch over to YouTube and put on your favorite playlist, head over to your mail app to respond to a client’s email, or search online for reference images on the same device. If you like to document your process, you can easily record your screen in 4K.</p><p>On the other hand, drawing tablets are designed exclusively for digital art creation. They simply provide creative professionals with a digital substitute for paper and pencil. You will often need another device to complete auxiliary tasks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=display-and-canvas-space>2. Display and Canvas Space</h2><p>When it comes to creating detailed digital art, display size matters. iPads come in various sizes, the largest being the iPad Pro at 12.9 inches. While this size may suffice for casual artists and beginners, some creative professionals might find it limiting for complex projects.</p><p>Drawing tablets offer a wider range of screen sizes, including larger options like the Wacom Cintiq Pro 32 with a 32-inch canvas. The larger the screen estate, the more room for creativity. The ample space affords creative professionals the luxury of working in relatively greater detail.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While drawing on an iPad, you can watch your imagination take form on the same screen. But that’s not the case with every drawing tablet. However, there are more expensive and high-end models with inbuilt displays.</p><p>Still, some drawing tablets are merely drawing surfaces you must use alongside a computer. So, as you sketch with the drawing surface, you need to glance at your computer screen to monitor your progress.</p><h2 id=pressure-sensitivity>3. Pressure Sensitivity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/person-holding-black-stylus.jpg><p>The higher the sensitivity level of a stylus, the more control you have over the pressure of your strokes. Apple hasn’t released the sensitivity level of its pencils. Many drawing tablets, like the Huion H610Pro V2, come with styluses with levels as high as 8,192.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With high pressure-sensitivity levels, you can have a more accurate and natural drawing experience. For drawing tablets, the stylus comes with a range of replaceable nibs, giving you some control over the style of your strokes. But you don’t get this with the Apple Pencil.</p><p>Additionally, you don’t have to charge the stylus that comes with your drawing tablet, as they don't usually come with batteries. While you do need to charge your Apple Pencil, the Apple Pencil 2 supports wireless charging and attaches magnetically to your iPad.</p><h2 id=flexibility-connectivity-and-portability>4. Flexibility, Connectivity, and Portability</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/person-drawing-on-an-ipad.jpg><p>You can use an iPad without a secondary display. So, it’s perfect for work on the go. You can slip it into your bag and carry it with you on most days. It’s easy to pull it out whenever and wherever, perhaps on the train or at the park, and continue to work on your drawing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But many drawing tablets are often bulkier and must be connected to a desktop or laptop before use. So you cannot use most drawing tablets alone, and when inspiration hits, you may have to wait until you get to your workspace and spend a few more minutes setting up.</p><p>Many drawing pads and tablets require cables to connect to your desktop or laptop. However, if you do decide to <a href=#>connect your iPad to your Mac using Apple’s Sidecar feature</a>, you don’t need cables. Also, Apple’s Continuity features are graciously extended to the Apple Pencil, allowing you to <a href=#>find your Apple Pencil</a> if ever you should lose it.</p><h2 id=software-options>5. Software Options</h2><p>A drawing tablet works well with the desktop version of drawing software. But the iPad is a mobile device that only runs software designed for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the iPad offers a decent array of software options to creative professionals, from Adobe Procreate to Adobe Fresco and Astropad, your graphic software options are still limited. For instance, the iPad version of Photoshop Sketch isn’t quite the same as the desktop version.</p><p>Most high-end software options are available only on computers. Whether it’s drawing software like Krita, Photoshop, or 3D modeling applications like Blender or Zbrush, you can access a full range of options with a drawing tablet.</p><h2 id=user-experience>6. User Experience</h2><p>When you buy a drawing tablet, you purchase a single-purpose device that aids your productivity. The iPad’s general-purpose nature may make it difficult to focus on your drawing when you get into work mode. An incoming notification can distract you, and a FaceTime call can disrupt your workflow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Furthermore, using the iPad to draw might feel unnatural to you. For one, the surface of the iPad is glossy; the texture isn’t quite like paper. If texture matters to you, the best drawing tablets are designed to imitate the paper and pencil experience. You can’t flip your Apple Pencil over to activate the erase function like a traditional pencil, but you can with the stylus on some drawing tablets.</p><p>The Apple Hover function that comes with Apple's M2 iPad Pro makes the Apple Pencil a cool tool to include in your creation process. However, only a few apps support the function.</p><h2 id=pricing>7. Pricing</h2><p>Several high-end drawing tablets cost more than the Apple Pencil and iPad. While they offer precision and accuracy, they might be out of your budget. Luckily, you can <a href=#>find pretty decent drawing tablets</a> that also cost a bit less than the iPad. But chances are they wouldn’t have displays.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So if display matters to you, but the high-end drawing tablets with displays are out of your budget, you should consider the iPad. It offers great value for money since you can use it for other activities aside from drawing.</p><h3 class="title icon i-list">Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>iPads are versatile devices that can multitask and perform various functions, making them suitable for creative professionals who need to switch between tasks easily.</li><li>Drawing tablets offer a wider range of screen sizes and provide more canvas space, allowing for more detailed and intricate artwork.</li><li>Drawing tablets typically have higher pressure sensitivity levels and offer more control over strokes, while the Apple Pencil may have limitations in this regard.</li></ul><h2 id=drawing-for-work-or-fun>Drawing for Work or Fun</h2><p>Deciding between an iPad and a drawing tablet primarily depends on how much drawing you do. For hobbyists, amateurs, and creative professionals who need a lightweight tool to work with on the move, the iPad and Apple Pencil combo is cost-effective. It’s great to use at leisure and offers a decent drawing experience.</p><p>The drawing tablet is a reasonable investment for advanced professionals who run sophisticated graphics software. Consequently, the return on their investment culminates in a more immersive drawing experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGigqZmUYsO0ecOrmLChnpx6ta3BpZytZZakv26w0ZquoqaXZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hugh-grant-sweetest-red-carpet-moments-wife-anna-eberstein.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wonka star Hugh Grant's sweetest moments with his wife Anna Eberstein</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jesse-morris-johnny-cash-sunday-morning-comin-down-cover-viral-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Street Musician's Johnny Cash Cover Goes Viral [Watch]</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
