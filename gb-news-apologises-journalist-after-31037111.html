Wootton immediately smirked after the former Lewis star made the remarks.</p><p>"Show me a single self-respecting man who would like to climb into bed with that woman ever who wasn't a cucked little incel," Laurence said. He then claimed she had been "spoon-fed oppression" which began with the issue of the gender pay gap, which sees that women earn less money than men for the same job.</p><p>He added: "We need powerful, strong amazing women who make great points for themselves.

Fans swarmed to support the journalist whilst many accused GB News of going too far.</p><p>Host Dan later directly apologised to Ava, claiming he was trying "to find your tweets to read back" from his iPad after Laurence made the comments. However, many called out his laughs during the interview, calling him insensitive.</p><p>Dan said: "Dear Ava I think you're brilliant. Earlier tonight I was attempting to find your tweets to read back from my iPad and couldn't locate them. I apologise for what was said during the course of my show and should have done this immediately on air.

He said his reaction to the situation was "inappropriate" and explained that he had been laughing "out of shock and surprise in an off guard moment".</p><p>The second statement read: "I want to reiterate my regret over last night’s exchange with Laurence on GB News. Having looked at the footage, I can see how inappropriate my reaction to his totally unacceptable remarks appears to be and want to be clear that I was in no way amused by the comments.</p><p>"I reacted as I did out of shock and surprise in an off guard moment while working out how to respond as he continued to speak by searching for tweets @AvaSantina had sent earlier in the day while having them read out in my ear at the same time. However, I should have intervened immediately to challenge offensive and misogynistic remarks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31037130.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Dan-Wootton-body-language.jpg><p>"I apologise unreservedly for what was a very unfortunate lapse in judgement on my part under the intense pressure of a bizarre exchange. I know I should have done better.</p><p>"I'm devastated that I let down the team and our supportive GBN family. We seek to tackle the issue and not the person, which I intend to stress again on air tonight."</p><p>GB News itself offered a statement on Twitter in the wake of the debacle, disowning Fox's comments as "unacceptable". The channel said it had launched an internal investigation into the scandal, saying Laurence's comments "does not reflect our values".</p><p>It read: "Comments made tonight on GB News by Laurence Fox were totally unacceptable. What he said does not reflect our values and we apologise unreservedly for the comments and the offence they have caused. We have launched an investigation and will be apologising to the individual involved."</p><p><b><i>For more of the latest showbiz and TV news from the Daily Star, make sure you sign up for one of our newsletters <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>here</a>.</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLSjec2erqxlkaW8rbvGoqqeq12fvLa%2BzZqjoqukYq6nwMSrZGxpYGiEcn2Q</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nano-influencers-pros-cons.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nano Influencers: Pros &amp;amp; Cons</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./charlie-goldsmith-wiki-married-family-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Charlie Goldsmith Wiki, Age, Wife, Daughter, Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
