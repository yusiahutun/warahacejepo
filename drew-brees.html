He has a younger brother Reid Brees.</span></p><p><span>Drew comes from a very athletic family. His father played basketball for the Texas A&M Aggies men’s basketball team, and his mother was a former all-state in three sports in high school.</span></p><p><span>His maternal grandfather, Ray Akins, is one of the great coaches in Texas high school football history, and his uncle Marty Akins was an All-Southwest Conference quarterback in 1975.</span></p><p><span>Reid, his brother, was an outfielder for the Baylor Bears baseball team. Also, his grandfather fought in the battle of Okinawa.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Untitled-design-18.png><p><span>When he was seven, his parents divorced, and they shared custody of the kids. While it was difficult for Drew and his brother, the whole situation brought the brothers closer.</span></p><p><span>They have a half-sister named Audrey from their father’s remarriage to Amy Hightower, daughter of late U.S. Representative Jack English Hightower.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Drew enrolled at <strong>Westlake High School</strong> in 1993. In high school, he excelled in basketball, baseball, and football.</span></p><p><span>The fall of 1996 was his senior season, and he led the club to a perfect regular-season record and a state championship.</span></p><p><span>Drew enrolled at <strong>Purdue University,</strong> where he continued to play as a quarterback. During the four years, he helped the Boilermakers win a Big Ten Championship and a trip to the Rose Bowl.</span></p><p><span>He graduated in 2001 with a degree in industrial management and was a Sigma Chi fraternity member.</span></p><h2><span>Drew Brees | Age, Height, And Physical Appearance</span></h2><p><span>Drew is <strong>44 </strong><strong>years old</strong>, and since he was born on 15 January, his zodiac sign is <strong>Capricorn</strong>.</span></p><p><span>He stands <strong>6 feet 0 inches</strong> (or 183 cm) tall and weighs <strong>209 pounds</strong> (or 95 kg).

His brown hair and brown eyes compliment his smooth skin, not to mention his muscular body structure.</span></p><h2><span>Drew Brees | Career</span></h2><p><span>Drew has had a spectacular career throughout his life. Here we dive into his career details.</span></p><h3><span>High School Football</span></h3><p><span>He initially considered playing college baseball, but he blew out his knee, after which his prospects changed. He became a quarterback as a junior in 1995.</span></p><p><span>However, he was not your typical quarterback; he was skinny and shorter than the usual quarterbacks. But his arm was the hero; when he made a pass, it flew straight and hard to the receiver.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Untitled-design-19.png><p><span>In 1996, during his junior year, he was selected as <strong>Most Valuable Offensive Player</strong>. He led the high school football team to a <strong>16-0 record</strong> and a <strong>state championship</strong>.</span></p><p><span>Drew completed <strong>314</strong> of <strong>490</strong> passes (64.1 percent) for 5461 yards with <strong>50 touchdowns</strong>. He was given an honorable mention in the state high school all-star football team and the All-USA high school football formation.</span></p><h3><span>College Football</span></h3><p><span>Drew truly shone during his sophomore year. He was an important part of Joe Tiller and Jim Chaney’s unorthodox “<strong>basketball on grass</strong>” spread offense and served as offensive captain during his junior and senior years.</span></p><p><span>During his junior year, he got the option to be in the <strong>2000 NFL Draf</strong>t but decided to return for his senior year to complete his studies.</span></p><p><span>In 2000, he led the Boilermakers to their first Big Ten Championship since 1967. Because of the win, Purdue won the invitation to the <strong>2001 Rose Bowl</strong>, their first appearance since 1967.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Throughout his college career, Drew set <strong>two NCAA records</strong>, <strong>13 Big Ten Conference records</strong>, and <strong>19 Purdue University records</strong>.</span></p><p><span>He completed <strong>11792</strong> passing yards, <strong>90</strong> touchdown passes, <strong>12,693</strong> total offensive yards, <strong>1026</strong> completions, and <strong>1678</strong> attempts, setting many records. In 2009, he was included in <strong>Purdue’s Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame</strong>.</span></p><h3><span>San Diego Chargers</span></h3><p><span>Drew was selected by the San Diego Chargers with the first pick in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft. He started as the backup to Doug Flutie.</span></p><p><span>Later on, he was named the starter. In the 2004 season, he started 15 games and led the team to a 12-4 regular-season record.</span></p><p><span>The San Diego Chargers won the AFC West for the first time in 10 seasons, and he was selected to the <strong>2004 Pro Bowl</strong>. He was named 2004 NFL Comeback Player of the Year.</span></p><p><span>Drew continued to be the starter quarterback for the 2005 season. He posted a career-high in passing yards with 3576. However, in his last game, he got injured and tore his labrum.</span></p><h3><span>New Orleans Saints</span></h3><p><span>After the 2005 season, Drew started looking for other teams as he was unsatisfied with San Diego Chargers’ offer. On 14 March 2006, he signed a six-year, <strong>$60 million</strong> deal with New Orleans Saints.</span></p><p><span>He set an NFL record with <strong>5476</strong> <strong>passing yards</strong> in 2011 and a career-best <strong>46 touchdowns</strong>.</span></p><p><span>On 7 February 2010, the New Orleans Saints defeated the Indianapolis Colts <strong>31-17</strong> in <strong>Super Bowl XLIV</strong>. Drew won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award.</span></p><p><span>He threw for 288 yards and 2 touchdowns.

In 2018, he surpassed the NFL records for completions and passing yards. He also completed a personal best <strong>74.4%</strong> of his throws and earned a <strong>12th Pro Bowl selection</strong>.</span></p><p><span>As of 2020, he has signed a two-year, <strong>$50 million</strong> contract extension with the New Orleans Saints.</span></p><h3>Retirement</h3><p>Entering into 2021, the Saints rearranged Brees’ contract to save salary cap space, which decreased his salary to <strong>$1.075 million</strong> for the upcoming season.&nbsp;</p><p>On March 14, 2021, fifteen years after signing his first contract with the New Orleans Saints, Brees declared his retirement after 20 seasons. He was placed on the reserve/retired list on June 11, 2021, by New Orleans Saints.</p><h3>Broadcasting</h3><p>After his retirement from his football career, he immediately joined NBC for the 2021-2022 campaign. As expected, the start of his broadcasting career was a little rough, given his very little experience as an NFL game analyst.</p><p>Amazon and Fox are patting their eye on the former quarterback to include him in their broadcast team.</p><h3><a href=#>Michael Thomas</a> pens down a heart-touching message after Drew’s retirement</h3><p>Thomas himself is known to be the best receiver in the NFL. When Drew announced his retirement, Michael got all emotional and penned down his thoughts to remind him how much he meant to him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Michael-Thomas-emotional-farewell-to-Drew.png><p>Thomas and Brees set several records together, and the most notable one was the single-season receptions record for most in a season held by Indianapolis Colt receiver<a href=#> Marvin Harrison</a>.</p><p>Thomas grabbed <strong>149 passes</strong> in 2019 for <strong>1,725 yards,</strong> both career highs. He also was titled the <strong>NFL Offensive Player of the Year in 2019</strong>.</p><h2><span>Drew Brees | Net Worth</span></h2><p><span>Drew is one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history.

In contrast, the actual worth was <strong>$6 million</strong>.</p><p>The couple came across the reality through an independent appraiser, as per the report from the San Diego Union-Tribune.</p><p>According to an earlier complaint, Brees and his wife claimed that the jewelry store owner Vahid Moradi (whom he has stayed in touch with for 15 years and believed him as an expert in valuing diamonds), sold them colored diamonds continually.&nbsp;</p><p>But the jeweler commented that he priced the diamond high as he believed the diamonds could be resold for that price in 10 to 15 years.</p><p>For all that, when the duo removed the diamonds from their settings to prepare them for sale, they understood the settings had been colored to make the stone look more aesthetic.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the couple’s lawyers contradicted his statement and said the diamonds were procured to diversify the Brees investment portfolio.</p><p>And according to CBSNews.com, the San Diego court allowed Brees a <strong>$6.1 million</strong> judgment against the jeweler.</p><h3><a href=#>Brittany Brees</a> stood by her husband through thick and thin</h3><p>Drew Brees’s wife Brittany comes in support of her husband and shares additional injuries her husband went through during the 2020 regular season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Brittany-talking-about-Drews-injury.png><p>If we have to align through Brittany’s Instagram post, we would clearly get that Drew faces these injuries; <strong>Torn Rotator Cuff (Shoulder)</strong>, <strong>Torn Fascia (Foot)</strong>, <strong>11 Broken Ribs</strong>, <strong>Collapsed Lung</strong>.</p><p>Talking about the whole 2020 season, Drew completed with <strong>2,942 passing yards</strong>, <strong>24 touchdowns</strong>, and <strong>six interceptions</strong> in 12 games.</p><p>While Drew was still recovering from <strong>11 fractured ribs</strong>, he survived Week 10’s victory against the San Francisco 49ers.</p><p>Brittany’s post might be a justification for Drew’s underperformance. We also know he has not notched three interceptions in a game since the 2016 season.</p><p>Additionally, when an athlete goes through a torn plantar fascia, it reduces the ability to plant his feet on passes. Drew Brees suffered a foot injury after a <strong>35-27</strong> defeat to the <strong>Detroit Lions</strong> on December 21, 2015.</p><h3>NFL’s Drew Brees is also an owner of a sandwich fast food restaurant</h3><p>New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees shares a different obsession with cheesy sliced sandwiches topped with leafy veggies or chicken.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, Drew grew his love for sandwiches when he was still in college at Purdue University. He recalls the moment when he used to order Jimmy John’s to his dormitory thrice a week.</p><p>But, talking about now, Drew himself is the owner of 5 Jimmy John’s Gourmet Sandwiches’ franchises and plans to own 20 more, according to &nbsp;<strong>Franchise Times&nbsp;Brees</strong>.
