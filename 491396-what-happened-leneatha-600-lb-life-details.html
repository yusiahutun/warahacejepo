There were complications with the procedure, with her lungs collapsing, leading her to be put on life support.</p><p class=align-left>During her recovery, Leneatha was put on steroids, which started her on an unhealthy eating trend. In addition, the surgery left her with scars, leading to depression and other mental health issues. As a result, she often used eating as a coping mechanism, which saw her rapidly gaining weight.</p><p class=align-left>Leneatha Reed attended <a href=#>high school</a> (presumably) in the Arizona area. She joined the workforce immediately after graduating high school. She resumed her education in 2015, enrolling at the University of Phoenix.

Leneatha gained the show's attention after her workout video (at the beginning of her weight loss journey) went viral. The producers contacted Leneatha and started documenting her story, which aired in the 16th episode of the eighth season.</p><p class=align-left>During her stint on the show, she worked with Dr Younan Nowzaradan, famously known as Dr Now, who helps contestants with their weight loss journey. Unfortunately, Leneatha was only on the show for one season and reportedly cut ties after it became harder to meet the showâ€™s schedules due to her responsibilities.</p><h2>Dating history</h2><p class=align-left>Leneatha Reed has not revealed much about her personal life. However, during her episode on <i>My 600-lb Life</i>, she revealed that she had been married once when she was 29.

Eventually, the marriage ended in divorce after her ex-husband cheated on her.</p><p class=align-left>After her divorce, Leneatha Reed met another man with whom he started a relationship. This relationship led to the birth of her daughter, Kenlyn, who is approximately four to five years old (as of 2023). Unfortunately, the relationship fell apart, with her partner walking away from her and their daughter on her first birthday.</p><h2>Net worth and earnings</h2><p class=align-left>What is Leneatha Reed's net worth?
