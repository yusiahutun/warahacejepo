We have tried to make things easier for you with our comprehensive guide. It will help you make an informed choice that best suits your routine and requirements. Here are some aspects you must consider to make that choice:</p><p><strong>Skin Type and Concerns</strong></p><p>Consider your skin type, whether it is normal, dry, combination, or oily, as different skin types have different requirements. For instance, a cream eye makeup remover or even hydrating cleansing balms work best for dry skin types as they help remove the makeup and leave the skin moisturized. Oily skin types should get an <a href=#>oil-based cleanser</a> as it will also effectively remove the sebum. Though, you must be careful as not oil-based formulas may suit you. That's not all. You must also consider if you have certain skin issues like rosacea, eczema, psoriasis, or skin sensitivity.</p><p><strong>Ingredients&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Check for the ingredients carefully and ensure that they are non-irritant and non-allergens. Look for natural and skin-soothing ingredients like chamomile, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, ginseng, cucumber extract, jojoba oil, and rose water. Avoid phthalates, sulfates, and mineral oils.</p><p><strong>Formula</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Typically, eye makeup removers for sensitive eyes are oil-based, water-based, or a culmination of both. Choose the one depending on your skin type and needs.</p><p><strong>Other Features</strong></p><p>Look for fragrance-free, alcohol-free, pH-balanced, and ophthalmologist-tested products and claims. This will ensure that the makeup cleanser of your choice is ideal for your sensitive eyes.</p><p><strong>Consult a Professional</strong></p><p>You may also consult a dermatologist or an ophthalmologist. If you have a serious history of allergies and sensitivities, particularly around the eye area, seek recommendations and advice from these professionals.</p><p><strong>Customer Reviews</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Check online reviews from other individuals with sensitive eyes. These real-life experiences will provide valuable insights into the product's effectiveness and suitability.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Remove Makeup Around Eyes?</h2></p><p>Here is a step-by-step guide (thatâ€™s also recommended by dermatologists) on how to gently and effectively remove makeup around the eyes:</p><ul><li>Start with washing your hands. This will prevent the transfer of dirt, oil, bacteria, and other impurities to the eyes.</li><li>Read the instructions given on the <a href=#>makeup remover</a>. If it is a two-phase remover, i.e., both water-based and oil-based formula, you must shake it gently to mix the components.</li><li>Take a cotton pad and moisten it with the eye makeup remover. It should have enough to saturate the pad but not so much that it drips.</li><li>Close your eyes and place the eye makeup remover-soaked cotton pad over your closed eye. Hold it in place gently for about 30 seconds. This will give enough time for the makeup to dissolve.</li><li>Now, gently swipe the pad downward and away from the eye.</li><li>Repeat as needed. Don't rub or tug at your delicate under-eye skin. You may increase the duration for which you press down the soaked cotton pad against your eyes for efficient removal.</li><li>Press the soaked cotton pad on your lashes for about 30 to 40 seconds to remove the mascara and other traces of makeup on the eye.</li><li>You may also use a Q-tip cotton swab to remove the liner along the waterline.</li><li>Repeat the same for the other eye.</li><li>Depending on the makeup remover, rinse it out with warm water. Follow up with a face cleanser to complete your double cleanse routine.</li><li>Pat your skin dry with a clean and soft towel.</li><li>Follow up with your regular skin care</li></ul><p>Your eyes and the skin around them require special care, particularly when you have sensitive eyes. You must look for the best eye makeup removers for sensitive eyes as they are approved by ophthalmologists and dermatologists. They are thorough at makeup removal but gentle on the eyes and surrounding skin. They have skin-soothing properties as well and don't require you to scrub, tug, or pull at your skin. Just like your eyes, the process of choosing the right eye makeup remover also requires utmost care. And with our complete guide on makeup removers for sensitive eyes, you can find your ideal cleansing partner with ease.</p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>Can eye makeup remover harm your eyes?</p><p>Eye makeup remover can irritate your eyes. If it doesnâ€™t do a good job of removing your eye makeup completely, it may lead to infection and ultimately cause harm to your eyes.</p><p>Can you use eye makeup remover on your face?</p><p>Yes, eye makeup remover can also be used on your face.</p><p>How often should you use eye makeup removers for sensitive eyes?</p><p>It is safe to use eye makeup for sensitive eyes daily at night if you happen to wear makeup daily.
