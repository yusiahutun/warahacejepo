interviews, saying it’s less about preserving himself than it is about pushing back against a culture that has become increasingly invasive and greedy for information.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s not really [because I] want to be guarded and private, it’s more a response to something else,” he tells the magazine. “The more you give—and

I think that’s just my response to a culture that has this increasing expectation that everything is going to be given. If you don’t post about the way you make your coffee in the morning, or if you don’t let someone take a picture when you walk out of your front door, is that being private? I don’t know if it is. So I just don’t really feed that. If you and I were having a conversation, and having a shandy in my house, and it wasn’t being recorded, then, of course, other things would be said.”</p><h2 data-node-id=44 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">March 26, 2022: They attend a pre-Oscars party.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a rare joint public outing, the two arrive at CAA’s Oscars pre-party in the San Vicente Bungalows looking happy and affectionate, sources say.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Taylor was introducing Joe to many people around her,” an onlooker tells <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/1324716/inside-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyns-date-night-at-pre-oscars-party data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="E!

And it was never a work thing, or a ‘Let’s try and do this because we’re going to put this out’ thing. It was just like baking sourdough in lockdown.

That’s what that song ‘Peace’ is talking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=92 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also tells McCartney, “I know you have done a really excellent job of this in your personal life—carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you’ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living. I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives.
