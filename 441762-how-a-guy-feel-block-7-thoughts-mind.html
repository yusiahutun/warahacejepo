When it comes to love and breakups, one communication power move that many people have encountered, in one way or another, is blocking. It has become easier for most girls to block their boyfriends and vice versa. While a girl may have a reason for blocking her boyfriend, the move sometimes presents itself as petty and prideful. Furthermore, blocking devalues the previous relationship with the boy and presents itself as too final. But how does a guy feel when you block him?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0737f6a297635f0b.jpg><p class=align-left>When a girl blocks a boy, she does not approve of him or is not attracted to him anymore. The action is harsh and can impact the boy in one way or another. However, while blocking can trigger a turmoil of emotions in a boy’s mind, there are many more who will accept the move with courage or an indication of moving on. But what goes on in a boy’s mind when he realises that his girlfriend has blocked him, and is it rude to block a guy?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4e24c9a903ca5f91.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does it mean when a guy initiates a hug? 5 things you should know</span></p></a><h2>Is it rude to block a guy?</h2><p class=align-left>Blocking a guy does not mean you are rude. However, the action can present itself as immature. Generally, your reason for blocking a guy may determine whether the move is rude or not. For example, it is rude to block a guy because you do not have a personal connection with him, or he ignored you, so you blocked him.</p><p class=align-left>Also, you do not have to block a guy because of a complicated argument or hurtful behaviour because you can solve such things through better communication. But if the person is toxic to you or harasses you all the time, then blocking him is justifiable for your peace of mind and not rude.</p><h2>What hurts more, blocking or ignoring?</h2><p class=align-left>Ignoring hurts more than blocking. Human beings are wired to have closure. Ignoring a guy can drive him crazy because he does not know what you are thinking. It is only natural for him to want an answer from you. But if the answer is not forthcoming because you ignore him, that can hurt him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d3497a3f3c893d12.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does it mean when a guy flirts with you but has a girlfriend?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On the other hand, blocking does not hurt much. When you block a man, you have at least given him a conclusion that you do not want them to reach out to you. It also means that he will not have to call or text you on any social media platform because he knows the calls or <a href=#>messages</a> will not go through. Therefore, he can finally move on to the next chapter.</p><h2>How does a guy feel when you block him?</h2><p class=align-left>Guys react differently when they conclude that their girlfriends have blocked them. Here are some of the thoughts that go on his mind when he realises you blocked him.</p><h3>He thinks the relationship is over</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4e24c9a903ca5f91.jpg><p class=align-left>Before technology advanced, or WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook became popular, boys and girls had easy closures. People used to communicate their decisions on why they ended their <a href=#>relationships</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Nowadays, however, you do not have to tell your boyfriend it is over. Instead, you only have to block them on all of your platforms. Once you make such a move, he will know that the relationship is over because he cannot communicate with you again. But that will all depend on the events that led you to block him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6aa5ae642a8f5867.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs your baby daddy wants you back but is scared to tell you</span></p></a><h3>He thinks he has made a mistake</h3><p class=align-left>When you block your boyfriend, you prevent him from viewing your profiles on social media, texting you on<a href=#> WhatsApp</a>, or calling you. That can make him question whether he made a mistake, especially if you do not tell him why you blocked him.</p><p class=align-left>Furthermore, he will go back in time to determine what mistake he made and how the mistake affected you. If he cannot get answers, your reason for blocking him linger in his mind.</p><h3>He thinks it is time to move on</h3><p class=align-left>Many men never take blocking lightly, primarily if they have invested so much in a relationship. But many also realise that you are cutting all forms of communication with them, thereby limiting your chances of solving the problems you had.</p><p class=align-left>In such cases, blocking gives him the idea that it is time to move on because you want nothing to do with him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e99c66cc474ef907.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs he doesn't care about the relationship and what to do</span></p></a><h3>He will be mad you blocked him</h3><p class=align-left>Ideally, it would be counterproductive for a man to get mad that you blocked him. However, sometimes getting mad is justifiable. First, he is in pain that you have rejected him.</p><p class=align-left>Then, suddenly, you block him by preventing him from communicating with you or trying to reconcile. Such a combination can upset him and make him mad, especially if he thought the two of you would iron things out.</p><h3>He will not care you blocked him</h3><p class=align-left>Most men do not care that you have blocked them. That mainly happens in relationships that turned out to be <a href=#>toxic</a>. Also, if you blocked him because you found out he was cheating on you, do not think he will care about it.</p><p class=align-left>However, if you blocked him and he doesn't care, it could mean he has already moved on from you, and your action is inconsequential. Men who do not care usually have a second plan in place.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e974b1ad64e30313.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why do guys stare but never approach me?</span></p></a><h3>He will think negatively about you</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d3497a3f3c893d12.jpeg><p class=align-left>When you block a man, you rarely give them the reason for your action. That makes him conclude that you are no longer interested in him. However, he can also think negatively of you.</p><p class=align-left>For example, he may think you <a href=#>blocked</a> him because you cheated on him. He may also think that you are rude and immature. His negative thoughts towards you will be because he does not have closure.</p><h3>He will want to find a way to solve the problem</h3><p class=align-left>Men are inherently problem solvers. When you block your boyfriend, you may think that you are ending any form of communication with him. However, one of his actions will be to find a way to solve any problems between you.</p><p class=align-left>He will even come to your place if he loves you or may use your friends to reach out. For some men, blocking them gives them the challenge to convince you to reconsider your decision.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f39ac4e902a235e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>My girlfriend has a celebrity crush: Should I be worried?</span></p></a><h2>Will he miss you if you block him?</h2><p class=align-left>Depending on the relationship, a boy may or may not miss you after you block him. For example, he will miss you if he deeply loves you. However, blocking means you have given him closure and may not miss you after the cloud passes.</p><p class=align-left>But at the same time, the question of whether or not he will miss you becomes immaterial. It now becomes a matter of whether you will miss him because you decide to cut any form of communication.</p><p class=align-left>How does a guy feel when you block him? Generally, men will think different when their girlfriends block them. For example, some will think they have made a mistake or negatively talked about you. But many more will think it is time to move on or find a way to solve the issue that led to the blocking. Although blocking may be rude or immature, it is better than ignoring him because he has some closure.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/30fb47cab9fc697b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>She stopped texting me out of nowhere! 8 possible reasons why</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke </a>shared an article detailing how to know if someone <a href=#>unfriended you on Snapchat</a> in a few steps.
