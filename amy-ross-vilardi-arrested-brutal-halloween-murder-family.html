Now, the two have been arrested for those very same murders.</p><p>On Friday, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>the Anderson County Sheriff's Office announced</strong></a> that the two were "arrested for the brutal killings of four people in Pendleton," seven years after the crimes took place. On that fateful evening, Amy's parents -- Cathy and Mike Scott, 60 and 59, respectively -- grandmother, 82-year-old Violet Taylor, and Mike's mother, 80-year-old Barbara Scott were all killed in an incident sheriffs said "rocked the Anderson County community to its core."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ed/4by3/2023/12/20/ed928ad0caed4c23ad117d422f90359f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Anderson County Sheriff's Office SC</span><p>At the time of the slayings, Amy said she found the bodies after opening the back door to the mobile home of the victims', who lived on the same property. She and her husband later went on TV to talk about discovering the bodies, while maintaining their innocence.</p><p>"When I went to knock on the back door, the door just pushed open so I walked in and it was dark and I just flipped the light on and there they were. They were just, they were there," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Amy said at the time</strong></a>.</p><p>"I don't understand why any of it has happened and I just keep thinking it's a dream I'm going to wake up from," she continued. "Whoever did this, I don't see how you can live with yourself."</p><p>When asked if she had a message for her family's murderers in another interview (below), she responded, "I can't say that on TV."</p><p>Now, she and her husband have both been charged with four counts of murder.</p><p>"I think we knew this day was coming, we were praying this day would come," Sheriff McBride said in a press release. "So far, a lot of prayers have been answered."</p><p>During a press conference, McBride also said the victims were "senselessly and brutally murdered," saying it "was a bad scene" and "probably what some of our folks would probably say was one of the worst things they’d ever seen."</p><p>All four victims were reportedly stabbed to death and shot postmortem, in what authorities said was a "gruesome" killing. No details were revealed as to why they were finally able to make an arrest, though that information should come out in court soon. They were first named as persons of interest by authorities earlier this year.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>FOX Carolina,</strong></a> the couple appeared in court on Saturday and were denied bond. Their next hearing will be in February.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ed388900-7f4b-41cb-81ba-1b663ac921d5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8d9d0aba-7194-434d-9e16-8ef6fb6bfa62 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4b/5by4/2023/12/18/4b56850f809f404f8289d61578accced_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Paducah Police Department/WPSD</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Woman Found Guilty of Brutally Murdering Husband Seen on Doorbell Footage Screaming 'Baby, No!'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtma2hflrq6edGoqqxlpp65or7DomSaqqKawLWxw2aZq62klrlutMClo6ivlZq7brnUq5ueql2brq61y7Jm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christmas-tree-decorate-real-flowers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Decorate your tree with real flowers this Christmas - find out how</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./travis-kelce-taylor-swift-not-spending-thanksgiving-together-8406093.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift Are Not Spending Thanksgiving Together, Despite Recent Reports</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
