Mana’s heartbroken grandmother, Malaika, took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Monday to announce the news.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1152338901-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-eka-darville-s-son-dies-from-aggressive-brain-cancer>Eka Darville’s son dies from aggressive brain cancer</h2><p>Despite several treatments in a bid to save Mana’s life, Malaika revealed on the Let’s Go Mana account that he had “left his body last night and took his last breath at 7:22pm.”</p><p>“Now he’s free, he’s dancing in the light,” she continued on the Monday live stream. “There’s no other child like Mana on this face of the Earth. “</p><p>Eka and his family, including his wife Lila, resided in Australia but reportedly relocated to the US to further treat the rare brain disease.</p><p>A GoFundMe was launched by Darville in February 2023 and at the time of his death, over $650K had been raised of the $1 million goal.</p><p>In the summer of 2022, Mana began having seizures, which were misdiagnosed as a brain abnormality. He suffered uncontrollable seizures for six months that left his right side paralyzed, the family explained. The tumor was only discovered in January 2023 after an ER trip found he had “two large lumps the size of a peach and a walnut spreading across his brain.” Emergency surgery was able to remove 40 per cent of one tumor.</p><p>In mid-April, Mana underwent a successful second surgery to remove the primary tumor but an October 18 update revealed that the tumor was “growing faster than ever” after months of progress.</p><p>Eka is best known for his role in the hit Marvel <a href=#>TV</a> series Jessia Jones alongside David Tennant. He also portrayed Scott Truman in Power Rangers RPM.</p><p>Mana’s death has prompted a wave of heartfelt tributes from fans and celebrities, including Home And Away star Isabel Lucas, who called the 10-year-old “a miracle”.</p><p>“Tears fill my eyes. Sweet Mana, we love you so much. We will feel your light always, true angel of earth,” she wrote. “May we remember to carry on Mana’s wise words on the meaning of life… ‘To have fun!’”</p><p>Lucifer actress Lesley-Ann Brandt wrote: “Mana, you are love and light personified. You will continue to change and impact the world.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2h%2BcMDRmp6enKlirrR5zJqpr52cYq6kwM6rqmZpYGLGpq3RZqalnF2ovK95w6KcrGWWp7yuecGrmKKmXZiur6%2FEq2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-eye-makeup-removers-for-sensitive-eyes-1242491.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>14 Best Eye Makeup Removers for Sensitive Eyes That Won't Sting</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taxstone-daryl-campbell-bio-age-height-jail-wife-net-worth-and-podcast.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taxstone (Daryl Campbell) Bio, Age, Height, Jail, Wife, Net Worth and Podcast</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
