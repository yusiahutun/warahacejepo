Don’t be alarmed, when you hear his story in full, you’ll understand why the actor chose to inform the entire room with his hilarious speech.</strong></p><p>Steve Carell and <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> worked together on The Big Short, alongside other great film stars. They were a part of a huge star-studded cast which saw the likes of Christian Bale and even <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> take part. It wasn’t the first time they worked together, though. The pair were also in the same 2011 movie, Crazy, Stupid, Love. But it seems the <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s hobbies away from the set ‘annoyed’ Steve.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1931912562-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-steve-carell-tells-sbiff-he-hates-ryan-gosling>Steve Carell tells SBIFF he ‘hates Ryan Gosling’</h2><p>The Santa Barbara International Festival, or SBIFF, takes place every February. It sees the likes of huge <a href=#>Hollywood</a> stars come together to celebrate the world of cinema. It’s also right in the middle of <a href=#>award show</a> season, so it’s a busy time for the stars.</p><p>At this year’s SBIFF, Steve Carell couldn’t help but tell an anecdote over the time Ryan Gosling invited him out. It doesn’t sound like it was the Space Force’s actor cup of tea, though. But he’s an incredible actor, so we’re sure he could have faked it if he needed to.</p><p>In a sneak peek clip of the upcoming SBIFF dinner, The Hollywood Reporter shared the funny video of Steve.</p><p>Steve Carell starts by saying: “It was the end of a shooting week, and we were standing outside our trailers and we were getting ready to leave for the weekend and talking about what our weekend plans would be.</p><p>“I was going to spend a quiet evening and weekend with my family, and Ryan told me his band had a gig that evening.</p><p>“‘Where?’ I asked, ‘A senior center in Glendale’, he replied.</p><p>“He was going to spend his Friday night playing music for some old folks in Glendale. Yeah, isn’t that just adorable.”</p><p>The crowd then applauds the actor’s cute plans, which doesn’t seem to please Steve.</p><p>He jokes: “Now a <a href=#>movie</a> star, would have told that story on a talk show, would have used it, gotten some juice out of it, monetized it, maybe it goes viral as a gif or a meme hashtag Ryan at the senior center.”</p><p>Steve Carell then ends the speech with: “But not Ryan Gosling, he did it just to make some old folks happy. And I find that annoying as hell.”</p><p>Okay, if you know Steve at all, he doesn’t actually hate The Notebook star. It’s classic comedy and a cute way of expressing Gosling’s sweet nature. But we appreciate how he did it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-steve-found-it-difficult-to-look-at-creepy-ryan-on-set>Steve found it difficult to look at ‘creepy’ Ryan on set</h2><p>However, when the duo worked together for The Big Short, with <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> on the bill, Steve wasn’t a fan of Ryan’s look. The flick is a biographical comedy surrounding the 2008 financial crisis. It follows a group of people, unconnected, who were affected by it. It also explains how it happened in an easy – but not dumbing down – digestible way.</p><p>Director Adam McKay asked the stars to change their look to suit their characters.</p><p>He said: “Everyone thinks of Wall Street as these polished guys, but these guys were characters, weird-looking dudes with strange clothes.”</p><p>But Ryan’s ‘creepy’ look caught the crew off-guard. Steve explained: “Ryan stepped out of the trailer for the first time with hair and makeup, and I told him, ‘Don’t ever do that again.”</p><p>He just couldn’t get over the fact Ryan wasn’t a heartthrob anymore.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eBcL%2FTnq2eZZOWv6a4y2afmqyVqHqzxcCnZKCno6G2r7OMm5ycmaWosm60yKxkpKGemXqosdKtrKudXayutHnAp6WosZmjtG6t0mafnqScZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./boho-fashion-trend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The history of Boho chic and why it's back for 2022</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stephanie-sigman-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stephanie Sigman- Interview with Stephanie Sigman</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
