Since Roland could only speak and understand a limited amount of English, a translator accompanied him to his first audition.</p><p>He received a standing ovation and astonished the judges after delivering his own interpretation of the iconic When a Man Loves a Woman song.

He was resilient enough to overcome his urban hardships.</p><p>When he ran out of money for food, he would spend his evenings singing karaoke for pleasure. A few years later, a trusted buddy came through for him by offering him a position in the fishing industry. Roland also started working at a motorcycle delivery service, where he shuttled customers and their stuff about town.</p><h3>Roland Abante Career</h3><p>Roland first began singing in elementary school and soon became a popular performer at school functions.

He was dogged in his efforts to realize his goal of becoming a musician. His perseverance paid off when a video of him performing a Michael Bolton song went viral in 2014.</p><p>Bunot’s viral video of him singing “To Love Somebody” got him a lot of attention from people all around the world. He never stopped making music or performing, and he became rather successful at both. Bunot also gave concerts in countries as diverse as the USA, Canada, and the UAE.
