Where is she currently?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Giaâ€™s Battle with Cancer</h2><p>Gia suffered sudden flare-ups of the sciatic nerve while filming the show. This was mainly due to complications from her previous cancer treatments.</p><p>Although she was cancer-free at the time of the show, she had been advised by her doctors not to fly. This meant that she couldnâ€™t continue filming.</p><p>Before the season started, Gia had spoken about her battle with cancer. She revealed how she was diagnosed with an aggressive type of cervical cancer in January 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2021/03/gina-facebook.jpg><p>She said that the condition had turned her life upside down because it came at a time that she wasnâ€™t insured.
