Does his decision got anything to do with his former relationship or is it just the way he feels right doing?</p><p>Well, let's see through to find out! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Conor Maynard Opts Not to Date, As of Now: But Why?&nbsp;</h2><p>If you are a big fan of Conor Maynard and groove to his songs, you might also know some major things about his personal life.&nbsp;</p><p>Born to parents Helen and Gary, Conor is equally recognized for being the brother of <a href=# rel=follow>Jack Maynard,</a>&nbsp;who&nbsp;was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">evicted </a>from 'I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here' due to his racial and gay, homophobic tweets. The family also comprises of his younger sister&nbsp;Anna, who has appeared in some projects that he has worked on as well. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The popularity Conor has garnered via his outstanding vocal has rewarded him with a huge fan base, who are not just curious about his new songs hitting the market&nbsp;but about his romantic unions as well!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Conor&nbsp;too&nbsp;keeps his fans updated which is why it is not rocket science&nbsp;that he is single as of now. But, he was once in a relationship with someone which ended up with a split, and the primary concern as of now is the reason behind him uttering his will to halt himself from dating again anytime soon!&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the fans know that he&nbsp;previously dated his model ex-girlfriend Victoria Tansey, but the star then called off the relationship back in mid-2015. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Speaking about the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">split</a>, he opened up,</p><p>"It was very very sad obviously but this break up wasn't a f*** you break up it was more of a mutual decision and having to do the right thing.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>"We had to be adults and realise what was best for us at the time.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Caption: Conor Maynard and his now former girlfriend Victoria Tansey while they were in a relationship.</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: dailystar.co.uk</p><p>Conor continued, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"There was no hatred or anything like that, it's hard though.</p><p>You can't help writing about a breakup as it is part of you - it takes over your life,&nbsp;</p><p>He concluded,</p><p>"I'm just working on my album so there will be a lot of breakup songs on there.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"You sometimes think that maybe you shouldn't write about it as then I will keep singing about it and not let the other person move on."</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">similar interview</a>, he also shed more light on the possible reason behind their split. Conor gushed,</p><p>“It was nearly impossible. Well, it was impossible — we broke up! You need someone who’s very confident and secure. It’s make me think maybe I should put off relationships for a while.”</p><p>Adding more to his statement, he explained as to how female attention can get tricky to handle,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“It was a problem. Girls would come up to me and they’d be drunk and trying to flirt. It’s a bit odd to be like ‘by the way I have a girlfriend’ so you have to be wary.&nbsp;If they asked for a picture they’d go: ‘Is it OK if I kiss you?’. There’s a thin line between all right and not. I’m not going to make out with them in a picture.</p><p>He ended explaining things, saying,</p><p>"If they ask to kiss your cheek, it’s kind of harmless, but if [your girlfriend’s] friend says, ‘Oh my God, there’s a picture of this girl kissing Conor’, it gets blown out of proportion.</p><p>"That’s why I’d say: ‘No, I can’t do that’. Sometimes [fans would] understand, sometimes they’d say: ‘You’re so up yourself’.”&nbsp;</p><p>This all makes sense as to why he has not expressed his will to date and have a girlfriend again, as he first wants to make things secure and stable in his life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fair play Conor!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpynnqS%2FbrnAsqWaqpRitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXqlrdOipaBll5bGbr%2FIp56lnV2lrrOxza2qZ6Ckork%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./married-sights-extreme-makeovers-revealed-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Married At First Sight's most EXTREME makeovers revealed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./burt-reynolds-lived-florida-estate-thanks-landlord-friend-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Burt Reynolds lived at Florida estate thanks to landlord friend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
