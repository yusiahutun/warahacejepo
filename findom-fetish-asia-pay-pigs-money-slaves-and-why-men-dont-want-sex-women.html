A fetish called “findom”, short for “financial domination”, lets some women do just that – their clients, called “pay pigs”, lavish them with cash and gifts for kicks, but no sex.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The costly kink is now being seen in Hong Kong, with local and visiting “dommes” offering findom services on the classified advertising site Backpage. And it’s spread to China as well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s a rather niche practice, even for us, and seems to be mostly online,” says a source in the Hong Kong kink scene who requests anonymity. The source adds that BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism) practices emphasise safe play and managing emotional and physical risks, and “with findom, I imagine the same should apply.”</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">In pictures: the Japanese art of rope bondage, as practised in Hong Kong</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Frank negotiations are vital to avoid problems down the line, the source continues, highlighting the need for appropriate rules – such as monthly transaction caps or the exclusive use of clients’ disposable income or put-aside cash for entertainment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/05/22/dcd53b96-3c51-11e7-8ee3-761f02c18070_972x_114711.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like Hong Kong’s findom scene, China’s is shadowy. But Chinese findom practitioners are out there. One enterprising woman, who goes by the name Pay2serveme, operates out of Liaoning in the country’s northeast.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 25-year-old, seen in her profile picture with a whip in one hand and a smartphone in the other, says she is looking for serious money slaves or pay pigs. She accepts seemingly any form of tribute: Amazon gift card, bank transfer, Western Union, Moneygram and Paypal, among other methods.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/05/22/c2f732ce-3c51-11e7-8ee3-761f02c18070_1320x770_114711.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One well-known Asian findom practitioner is Philippines-born, Seattle-based Sydney Max Lee. Lee, 26, who goes by the name Astro Domina, has been in the game since December 2011. “Obviously I wasn’t super successful back then, but it was the beginning of everything,” she says.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I just love the idea of a man who is willing and grovelling and on his knees right in front of me, handing over all of his moneyAstro Domina, financial dominatrix</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After she started sharing online, submissive men began queueing up, lured by her dominant alpha Asian persona amplified by her willingness to share her life over social media. Her face and curves help, too, and she cuts a contrast with many other Asian women. “They’re light-skinned, really skinny. What else? Kind of flat around the chest and no butt at all.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When asked why she got into findom, she says: “I just love the idea of a man who is willing and grovelling and on his knees right in front of me, handing over all of his money. It’s a euphoric feeling – it’s a type of power exchange that I just love.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee is a mix of four ethnicities: Chinese, Filipino, Spanish and Egyptian. Raised in Manila, she migrated to Seattle when she turned 21. And by cornering the curvy Asian domination market, Lee has become a rich woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/05/22/c32a5cf8-3c51-11e7-8ee3-761f02c18070_1320x770_114711.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In one session, I have made everything from US$3,000 to US$20,000. It goes up and up and up,” she says, pegging her annual earnings at US$300,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite her professional emphasis on tributes, she looks down on the gold-digging findom practitioners she calls “rinsers”. In her view, a dominatrix must avoid seeming money hungry and greedy. Her own attitude is motherly. Regarding her slaves, she says: “They’re my little puppies. They’re my little pets. And I feel like I’m the mum and they’re my kids, and so I feel that I nurture them.”</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Sex, fries and videotape: the bizarre food porn of S Korean web sensation Showry</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to dominance blogger Mixtrix, many findom clients are highly successful. Their well-paid work involves much managerial responsibility and because of this, “they crave the ability to let go and have someone else be in charge”, she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Being freed from the need to play that stressful role feels good, according to Mixtrix, who has a full-time live-in house slave.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For fellow blogger and money slave Massimiliano, 40, findom is thrilling and he loves the abuse – the sensation of being teased by beautiful women so that he loses control of his actions and his money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/05/22/aff27e0e-3c51-11e7-8ee3-761f02c18070_1320x770_114711.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He accepts, even condones, sex being out of the question, as this would make the dominatrix seem less powerful in his eyes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To sustain his fetish, the IT worker also takes on other jobs outside office hours, unable to quit his fetish. “I tried. It’s impossible.” Massimiliano estimates he has spent US$125,000 on his masochistic obsession.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I get excited by giving women money. So what?Massimiliano</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A classic study by deviance experts Roy Baumeister and Jennifer Butler found that more men are masochists than women, and such men prefer acts that emasculate them, such as in findom.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On what it takes to succeed as a findom practitioner, Mixtrix says: “The good dommes make it look easy, but most dommes who try will fail or quit when they discover it is not a get-rich-quick scheme. The domme must be interested in dominating and controlling men, or it will not work.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The secret is understanding that findom is about sadomasochism, not money. “It is all about power exchange,” says Mixtrix, who was previously a cocktail waitress.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She believes the domme must never appear to be in need of money, because that lowers her status and puts the “pay pig” in charge – the opposite of what he craves.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Film review: Dawn of the Felines – Tokyo sex workers’ melancholic tales in roman porno reboot</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mixtrix denies that the pay pigs are being exploited. “It is a consensual erotic exchange,” she says, stressing the importance of consent. “The men who participate are engaging in a need, the same as any other fetish.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Massimiliano doesn’t think there is anything weird about findom, adding that the fetish scene is full of things that are hard to understand. “I get excited by giving women money,” he says. “So what?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwMico55nYmWGdYWVbWafoZ6ZvK55xZ6roquYYq60tcBmp5qxXaW2qL%2BMpqannaliwK2t1Z6qZpmemXq4tNhmpJ6mXZm8r8CMsJinrF2osrl51qiknqY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dave-matthews-band-releases-10th-studio-album-walk-around-the-moon-launches-tour.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dave Matthews Band Releases 10th Studio Album Walk Around the Moon &amp;amp; Launches Tour</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shashank-khaitans-mentor-disciple-entertainment-trigger-happy-studios-team-up-for-exclusive-multi-film-deal-1282446.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shashank Khaitan's Mentor Disciple Entertainment, Trigger Happy Studios team up for exclusive multi-</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
