This location is also where the YSL boutique is located. Originally, it featured a well-known blend of floral aldehydes. However, in the 2000s, the fragrance was enhanced with distinct woody and aromatic elements. The aldehyde notes now harmoniously blend with pelargonium and rose absolute, gently toning down the sharp metallic aspect of the original formula. The fragrance culminates in a comforting fusion of oak moss, vetiver, musk, and balsamic notes. Despite these changes, Rive Gauche remains easily identifiable, right down to its artistic bottle design.</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Has a sophisticated and mature scent</li><li>Great for formal occasions</li><li>Refreshing and cooling</li><li>Great for gifting</li></ul><li class="product_info_li border_bottom" readability=-0.64102564102564><p>6</p><p>Most Iconic Fragrance</p><a href=# rel=sponsored title="Yves Saint Laurent OPIUM Eau de Toilette" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_title","B00G0U1PPS","-"),triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1247253","2023-09-29 20:33:46","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-ysl-perfumes-for-women-1247253","Select","Beauty","B00G0U1PPS","Yves Saint Laurent OPIUM Eau de Toilette","6","Product Title")' readability=2><p><h3>Yves Saint Laurent OPIUM Eau de Toilette</h3></p></a><a href=# rel=sponsored title="Yves Saint Laurent OPIUM Eau de Toilette" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_Image","B00G0U1PPS","-")'><img alt="Yves Saint Laurent OPIUM Eau de Toilette" title="Yves Saint Laurent OPIUM Eau de Toilette" width=auto height=auto onclick='triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1247253","2023-09-29 20:33:46","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-ysl-perfumes-for-women-1247253","Select","Beauty","B00G0U1PPS","Yves Saint Laurent OPIUM Eau de Toilette","6","Product Image")' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51g+dmStzaL._SL500_.jpg></a></li><p>Indulge in one of Yves Saint Laurent’s classic perfumes, “Opium”.
