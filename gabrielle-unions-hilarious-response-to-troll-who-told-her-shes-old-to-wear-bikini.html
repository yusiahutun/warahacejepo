Gabrielle revealed her response to one netizen who made a comment about women wearing swimsuits at the age of 50.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/07/GettyImages-1235505282-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gabrielle Union claps back at troll for bikini comment</h2><p>The Bring It On actress is proud of her fit figure, which she manages with grueling workouts, and doesn’t shy away to call out trolls who have remarks about the choice of her swimwear.</p><p>In an interview with editor Jasmine Fox-Suliaman on the podcast Who What Wear, the 50-year-old <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star revealed that she was told she was “too old” to wear thong bikinis.</p><p>“Somebody said, ‘You’re old enough to be somebody’s grandma, why are you still in — like wearing swimsuits?’” she recalled in the podcast episode. “I’m like, ‘First of all, they’re not just swimsuits. They are thongs. And you’re gonna see these cheeks until my ass literally falls off, and I might just wear a bikini in the casket.”</p><p>The actress, who stars in the new <a href=#>Netflix</a> rom-com The Perfect Find, is the cover star of Who What Wear’s July 2023 edition.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The actress gave a powerful message</h2><p>Elsewhere in the podcast interview, Gabrielle gave a powerful message to all listeners and highlighted society’s remarks and the way some people treat women when they reach a certain age.</p><p>“(When you’re) 35, they start treating you like you’ve got osteoporosis,” she said. “You start becoming invisible, and it’s a weird, empty feeling to feel like you’re disappearing in front of your own eyes. You start taking on the same attitude as a society that believes that you lack value.”</p><p>Gabrielle continued: “I don’t want anyone else to feel that invisibility and that sense of worthlessness because the only people that we need to validate us are us. And sometimes, the more that you validate your damn self, the more people are like, ‘Yeah.’”</p><p>The actress has blessed her <a href=#>Instagram</a> fans and followers with pictures from her holidays with her husband Dwayne Wade and their children. The celebrity family was recently in Egypt and Gabrielle shared a string of snaps from the sun-kissed vacation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gabrielle-s-family-with-dwayne-wade>Gabrielle’s family with Dwayne Wade</h2><p>The former America’s Got Talent judge is married to former NBA star Dwayne Wade.
