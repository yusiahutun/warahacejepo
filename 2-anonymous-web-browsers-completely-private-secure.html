Fortunately, it's easy to start using a browser that prioritizes your privacy.</p><p>Here are a few of the best private browsers that are (almost) completely anonymous.</p><h2 id=why-use-an-anonymous-web-browser>Why Use an Anonymous Web Browser?</h2><p>Private information is big business, and everyone is trying to watch you. The secret services, governments, Microsoft, cybercriminals, and your creepy neighbor from across the street all want to know what you're doing all the time.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>While it's almost impossible to completely remove yourself from the global grid, there are some steps you can take to reduce your information footprint.</p><p>The best place to start is with your browser. It's your main portal to the web, so using a more secure option will make a big difference to your privacy.</p><p>Simply enabling private browsing in your current browser isn't enough. You need a new browser to achieve true anonymous browsing.</p><p>Here are some options.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=tor-browser-windows-mac-linux>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tor Browser</a> (Windows/Mac/Linux)</h2><p>The Tor network has one simple goal: anonymous browsing. It's the best private web browser available and the <a href=#>best browser for accessing the dark web</a>.</p><p>The network aims to protect a user's location, browser history, personal data, and online messages from any person or bot that's performing network traffic analysis.</p><h3 id=how-does-the-tor-browser-work>How Does the Tor Browser Work?</h3><p>Network traffic analysis is arguably the most powerful weapon in a data collector's armory. It can track your behavior and interests for advertising companies, it can lead to price discrimination on online shopping sites based on location, it can even reveal your identity to people who might want to silence or harm you.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Basic encryption techniques don't protect you against traffic analysis. Data sent over the internet has two key aspects: the payload and the header.</p><p>The payload is the actual data (for example, the contents of an email); the header helps the data get to its destination. It includes information such as source, size, and timestamps. Encryption can only hide the payload, not the header.</p><p>And that's when Tor comes in. It sends your internet traffic through so many individual relays and tunnels that the header is nonsensical to traffic analysis tools. In simple terms, instead of going directly from A to B, the network sends your traffic on a maze-like route through many locations.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>A sniffer looking at a single point on that route has no way to tell where the traffic originated or where it's going.</p><h3 id=tor-browser-standout-features>Tor Browser Standout Features</h3><p>To access the Tor network, you need to use the Tor browser. It's so secure that the US Navy uses it for intelligence gathering. Tor is also used by law enforcement organizations who want to visit websites without leaving government IP addresses in the site's log.</p><p>You don't need to install any software on your machine; the browser is a portable app that can live on a USB stick. It means you can use the service regardless of what computer you're working on, even if it's in a public location such as a library or university.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The design of the browser will be instantly recognizable to Firefox users, but there are a couple of notable changes. The biggest difference is the integration of NoScript, included by default. Unlike the regular NoScript add-on, which can be complicated to use, the Tor version has an easy-to-use slider to manage your privacy.</p><p>There are also some downsides to using the Tor Browser. For most users, the biggest issue is speed. Because your traffic is taking such a twisty route to get to its destination, your browsing experience will not be as fast. If you have a good connection, it might not be an issue, but if your internet speed is slow, Tor might become painful to use.</p><p>Ultimately, while Tor is the most anonymous browser option, it doesn't guarantee anonymity. Taking online risks—such as downloading torrents or illegally streaming live TV—will still leave you vulnerable. But when compared to the mainstream browsers like Chrome and Safari, there is no contest.</p><h2 id=epic-browser-windows-mac>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Epic Browser</a> (Windows/Mac)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/epic-browser.jpg><p>Epic Browser doesn't use a specialized onion network, but it immediately disables lots of the most common ways your privacy is compromised when surfing the web.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>For example, this free private browser doesn't save your history, there's no DNS pre-fetching, it doesn't allow third-party cookies, there are no web or DNS caches, and there's no autofill feature.</p><p>The browser automatically deletes any associated databases, preferences, pepper data, and cookies from Flash and Silverlight when you close your session.</p><p>Epic Browser will also protect you against newer scams and malware, such as fingerprint scanners, crypto mining, ultrasound signaling, and more.</p><h2 id=srware-iron-windows-mac-linux-android>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SRWare Iron</a> (Windows/Mac/Linux/Android)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iron-browser-facts.jpg><p>If you're a Google Chrome user, SRWare Iron will be familiar; it's based on the open-source Chromium project, so a lot of the on-screen visuals look very similar.</p><p>The main difference between Chrome and SRWare Iron is data protection. Experts have criticized Chrome for its reliance on a "Unique User ID"; every time you start a session, Google is alerted to your data usage.</p><p>SRWare strips out the usage of an ID along with <a class=no-callout href=#>other Chrome privacy issues</a> such as search suggestions. It makes SRWare Iron a great secret web browser.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=comodo-dragon-browser-windows-mac>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Comodo Dragon Browser</a> (Windows/Mac)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/commodo-browser.jpg><p>Comodo doesn't come close to Tor Browser, but it does have some built-in tools that'll make browsing the web a safer experience.</p><p>For starters, this private web browser will automatically block all tracking, cookies, and web spies. It comes with built-in domain validation technology that'll instantly segregate <a href=#>strong and weak SSL certificates</a>, and it uses the Comodo antivirus suite to protect you from ransomware, viruses, and other attack vectors.</p><p>Like SRWare Iron, it's based on Chromium, so it'll be an easy switch for a lot of people. It has two versions—one that looks like Chrome and one that looks like Firefox. Choose whichever you are more used to.</p><h2 id=why-aren-39-t-there-any-other-recommendations>Why Aren't There Any Other Recommendations?</h2><p>It's surprisingly difficult to find high-quality free private browsers that focus on your anonymity and security as primary features.</p><p>Note that if you want to truly stay safe and enjoy anonymous browsing online, you should definitely pair your anonymous web browser with a reputable VPN that cares about your privacy.</p><p><strong>Don't know which VPN to use? We highly recommend ExpressVPN. If you use <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this link</a>, you can get three FREE months when you sign up for one year.</strong></p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fZ3qius6nsKanpah6uLHBZpmrp6eosrO%2FjJympqicmsGmuNhmp6uhppbBpnnSnpquqpVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tragic-death-wwe-superstar-chyna-laid-rest-rhinestone-urn-sea-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Death of WWE superstar Chyna who was laid to rest in a rhinestone urn at sea</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-face-moisturizers-for-men-1289606.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>11 Best Face Moisturizers for Men to Suit Their Hydration Needs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
