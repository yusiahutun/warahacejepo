proposed that Teng had been reincarnated as a Thai girl, Vanatsaya Viseskul, who, then 16, looked like the Teng of her 1960s album covers, and, while not knowing a word of Mandarin, was able to perform a much of the Taiwanese singer’s repertoire with miraculously high fidelity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Teng, who was born in a humble Taiwanese military village in 1953, was the first megastar of modern Chinese pop, selling more than 48 million albums worldwide and inspiring adoration unlike any singer before her.</p>Although her music was banned as pornographic in China during the 1970s, her influence on the mainland was still compared to that of <a

datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was also commonly said that “wherever there are Chinese-speaking people, there is the music of Teresa Teng”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The controversies following her death centred on events in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai, where she spent her last years. And both the preserved hotel room where the singer spent her final days, and a second memorial created by the hotel’s former head butler, Praphan “Billy” Bonsook – one of the last people to see the singer alive – present an image slightly at odds with that of the “classic Teresa”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Here, she is not known chiefly as the angelic child prodigy or the pan-Asian superstar. Instead she is remembered by those who knew her as a mature woman who sought to escape from the monster of her fame, who took a Western lover and pined for a simpler, more anonymous life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Before, it was not easy to say some of these things,” says Praphan, who retains a clear image of Teng’s final years and final hours.</p>He and other long-time staff at the Imperial Mae Ping Hotel – now rebranded as the <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">InterContinental Chiang Mai The Mae Ping</span></a> – are able to dispel many of the conspiracy theories surrounding the superstar’s death.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/00737d71-bd97-4130-8ed5-e0a95c1d6a61_8f7da9af.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Praphan, a youthful 54-year-old and still the dapper host, has two large Teresa Teng pins on his vest as he cheerfully welcomes me to The Story of Teresa Teng by Billy, his self-created memorial behind a shopfront set amid strip malls on Chiang Mai’s eastern fringe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Now some time has passed, I think it’s OK to talk about what happened,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bus tours of mainly Chinese tourists come to pay their respects, take afternoon tea and sing karaoke. Walls are adorned with photos of Teng in Thailand and other memorabilia collected with the help of Teresa Teng fan clubs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The afternoon I arrive, three Chinese tour groups are expected to bring more than 50 visitors, which Praphan says is typical.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From the start of Teng’s career, she had a huge fan base among the Thai-Chinese community, many of whom lived in the north, especially in Chiang Mai, and Teng made her first visit to the kingdom in 1971 at the age of 18, promoting a Hong Kong musical comedy film, I Want to Sing (Ge Mi Xiaojie).</p>In Chiang Mai 29 years ago, she was not so special. She was just like a normal personPraphan “Billy” Boonsuk, former butler<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two years later, she released a cheerful ode to the country with the song “Flower of Love” (Qing Hua), which opens with the lyrics, “Thailand is a wonderful place” (taiguo shi ge hao difang).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over the following decades, Teng would return repeatedly, in the early years offering performance runs in Bangkok music halls.</p>Photographers captured her as a darling ingénue on visits to <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Thai temples</span></a> and Bangkok gold shops; her movements made headlines in Thailand’s Chinese-language press.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More than two decades after her first visit to Thailand, she was at the tail end of her career and her only desire was to avoid the limelight. So, in 1993, she found a retreat in Chiang Mai, Thailand’s “rose of the north”, 700km (430 miles) north of Bangkok.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although still giving occasional concerts or television performances, she had already put out what was to become her final album four years earlier. She was 40 years old, not in the best of health, and weary of her celebrity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She didn’t want to be a superstar any more,” says Praphan. “So she escaped.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/4c17df4f-bfff-4bdb-8042-a8a4e818e33e_05622481.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Chiang Mai native, Praphan began working as a butler at the Imperial Mae Ping Hotel at the age of 20.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Excelling in his duties, he was soon promoted to the concierge desk on the hotel’s 15th and uppermost floor, where he would go on to attend Thai royalty, Malaysian sultans and the King of Bhutan. He met Teng on her first visit to the hotel, in 1993.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I didn’t know Teresa Teng or her music,” recalls Praphan, who nevertheless noted that the floor’s other six staff members, all older, were in awe of Teng and shied away from her.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Not me,” says Praphan, who, smiling and gregarious, would develop a familiarity with Teng, chatting and joking with the singer on an almost daily basis. “In Chiang Mai 29 years ago, she was not so special,” he says. “She was just like a normal person.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Opened in 1991, the Imperial Mae Ping was Chiang Mai’s first internationally managed luxury hotel, its 15-storey modern, arc-shaped tower set behind an expansive, lush, northern Thai-style garden.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/cd842fb5-5e93-40ed-b6f6-16e4e160e827_86c30232.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Teng first arrived in the city, she stayed at the Royal Princess Hotel, but soon went looking for an upgrade. It was Praphan who showed Teng around on her initial visit to the Mae Ping, when she asked to see the nicest, most spacious room for a potentially long stay, he recalls.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He showed her the Royal Prince Suite, which was decorated with a mix of rustic northern Thai-style ornaments, comfortable Western furnishings, wood-panelled walls, Lanna carvings, patterned tapestries and wrought-iron chandeliers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The anteroom had an eight-person dining table, sofa set, recliner and a rocking chair, while an almost equally enormous bedroom included more seating, built-in wardrobes and a writing desk.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Windows looked northwestwards, affording views of the old walled city and the majestic Doi Suthep, a gently sloping, 1,676-metre granite peak that sits like a guardian on Chiang Mai’s western flank.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Teng made the booking on the spot, not at all dissuaded by the room’s price of 30,000 baht (US$1,000 at the 1993 exchange rate) per night. Renting by the month, Praphan recalls, “We gave her a discount.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">She’s just like Teresa Teng, Faye Wong: 42-year-old singer’s star is rising</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although Teng’s stay in Chiang Mai is often characterised as a holiday, Praphan remembers she spent the greater portion of her final two years there, departing mainly on short trips for visa runs or concerts, and generally returning within days.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During this time, Praphan served Teng breakfast in her suite every day at 9am, then returned with cleaning staff between 1pm and 2pm. In the evenings, he says, the singer would dine out and often stroll through the nearby night market along Kampangdin Road.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Praphan describes Teng as being friendly, chatty and constantly making fun. She coached him in English and Japanese phrases, and he returned the favour, teaching her snippets of Thai.</p>In photographs displayed at the <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Chiang Mai memorials</span></a>, one notices a significant presence in Teng’s life that is mostly absent in other memorials, including her gravesite, on Yangming Mountain, north of Taipei. It is that of her lover and fiancé, Frenchman Paul Quilery.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The couple met in Paris in 1989, when Teng was roaming incognito through the French capital and seeking to escape the demands of fame in Asia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/85cece14-6d33-4244-8248-b8e85a5b620d_7d986bb4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The meeting came via an introduction from Teng’s guitarist, Quilery’s friend. Quilery himself was tall, with long, straw-blond hair, austere Nordic good looks and a feature that likely later fuelled suspicion among some Chinese fans: facial expressions largely devoid of emotion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was also 15 years Teng’s junior, he 21 and she 36 at their initial meeting. Yet a spark was ignited. He invited Teng to his studio for a photo session, then another. The pair would stay together for the rest of Teng’s life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was only after Teng died, however, that the couple’s relationship became widely publicised.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese- and Japanese-language news reports in the wake of the star’s death began to define the figure of “Paul” for an Asian readership.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some of that early, sensationalist coverage has snowballed over the years into full-blown conspiracy theories, which continue to malign, slander and disparage the Frenchman, often with racist undertones.</p>He immediately burst into tears, cried all the way back to the hotel, and then locked himself in the roomPaul Quilery’s reaction to Teng’s death, according to Praphan<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In web searches, top hits for “Paul Quilery” lead to articles referring to him as a “boytoy” or “Teresa Teng’s baby French boyfriend” and from fake news sites to TikTok, insinuations of domestic violence and even murder are common.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One blogger alleges “either he intentionally killed her, or she was killed by his selfishness”. Others charge that had he been a properly attentive boyfriend, Teng would be alive today.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even Wikipedia alleges that Quilery maintained “a rather indifferent attitude towards her sudden death”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Praphan says that none of this is true, and contemporaneous Taiwanese media reports on Teng’s death support his claims.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Quilery learned that Teng had died, Taiwan’s United Daily News reported, “he immediately burst into tears, cried all the way back to the hotel, and then locked himself in the room”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">From Teresa Teng to bridal laments of rural Hong Kong, singer draws inspiration</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two days later, after accompanying her body to Taiwan, Quilery was described as having “red and swollen eyes, obviously having passed another night of heartache”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Praphan, whose concierge desk had a direct view of the door to their suite, avers that over the course of two years, he never heard raised voices or any evidence of arguments, fights or violence between the couple.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I could feel that they loved each other,” he says. “When Paul talked to her, it was always very gently.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For many Asian fans, Quilery exists as a fly in the buttermilk of Teng’s hagiography, and an inconvenient reminder that the star aspired to break free from the straitjacket of Chinese patriarchy imposed upon her by Asian fans and media, Taiwan’s government – which used her as a propaganda tool for much of her career – and even the whims of her own family.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1998, three years after Teng’s death, Quilery finally went public with details about the life he and Teng shared, releasing home videos and candid photos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/c092aafe-01df-4202-bff5-1b8f9ca1d6ee_2a48f19f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In reply, the singer’s younger brother, Jim Teng Chang-hsi, asserted the Frenchman had no right to pry into family matters, saying, “He should still not violate the rights of others […] If he says things that the person concerned cannot refute, according to the morality of we Chinese, this is not appropriate.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Teresa’s older brother, Frank Teng Chang-fu, meanwhile, tended to diminish Quilery’s attachment to his sister, often referring to him as “just a friend” rather than a “boyfriend” or “fiancé”.</p>Quilery, in a 1998 interview with Hong Kong’s <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">TVB Jade</span></a>, shot back that Teng’s family perpetrated a public image of the star at odds with the woman she had actually become.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her brothers wanted to present her “like a young girl, a young virgin”, he said, despite the fact that she was over 40 years old. “But she was a woman,” Quilery insisted. “Forty years old is not a baby any more.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Teng’s five years with Quilery were perhaps her deepest and most abiding romance, and in some ways flout the conventional Teresa Teng narrative, which maintains that she was never lucky in love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/0d335b9a-df7e-42ac-af10-138b434d0ac5_0ad5df36.jpg>In her teens and twenties, she lost one Malaysian magnate’s heir to a premature death. Later, she had a rocky three years with kung fu film star Jackie Chan, then broke off her relationship with <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a second Malaysian billionaire</span></a> when his family demanded she halt her singing career and give a full written account of her sex life.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet, in April 1995, Teng and Quilery got engaged on the grounds of a prominent Chiang Mai Buddhist monastery, Wat Suan Dok. And it was Teng who made the proposal. In the 1998 Jade TV interview, Quilery was asked by the host, “So she asked you, ‘Should we get engaged?’”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Yes,” Quilery replied, noting that the wedding was set for August 1995. He then further confirmed the interviewer’s suggestion that Teng “was ready to establish a family”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The day of May 8, 1995, is still clearly etched in Praphan’s memory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As every other morning, the butler served breakfast to Teresa and Paul in their suite. “Then I asked her, ‘Oh, would you like anything else?’ But she said, ‘No.’”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Remembering 11 Chinese stars who were taken from us too young</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Quilery would frequently go out alone in the afternoon and around 3.30pm, Praphan remembers, “Paul went out to buy some flowers, rent a video and buy some fruit. She loved mangosteens.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not long after, around 4.15pm, Teng burst out of the room, wet from the shower and in obvious distress. “She was naked,” says Praphan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He and two female members of staff were manning the 15th floor concierge’s desk as Teng staggered towards them and uttered words that to Praphan sounded like “Mama, mama,” then collapsed. Fetching a dressing gown, they clothed Teng and sat her in a chair.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She was still alive,” says Praphan, “but unconscious.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The situation was dire, but it was not Teng’s first health crisis. The singer’s health had been shaky for several years, and in December 1994, she had spent a night in a Chiang Mai hospital on an intravenous drip after complaining of dizziness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/8602ee80-c1ae-4e89-b267-824b84281a21_2a48f19f.jpg>Two months later, after she and Quilery spent the Lunar New Year in Taiwan, she began suffering from respiratory problems, possibly a flu or even <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">pneumonia</span></a>. Quilery later described her as having a persistent cough, but “not really asthmatic”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Teng collapsed naked on the carpet of the hotel, it was rush hour in Chiang Mai and its streets were clogged. Rather than wait for an ambulance, the Imperial Mae Ping’s general manager decided to send her to the hospital in a hotel car, which had no life-saving equipment or personnel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 4km trip to Chiangmai Ram Hospital would have normally taken just over five minutes, but mired in traffic, the drive took more than 20 minutes. By the time the car arrived, Teng was not breathing, her face was blue and her pupils dilated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Emergency room staff spent around 45 minutes trying to revive her, using CPR, injections and a defibrillator, but to no avail.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At 5.30pm, they pronounced her dead, and it was only when Dr Sumet Huntrakul went to fill out the death certificate that he realised the patient they had been trying to revive was Chinese music’s biggest star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/ce6a30f4-efb7-4e3b-853c-205a800ee6e6_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Teng’s superstar status allowed her to collect various citizenships, and she used these to keep a low profile while travelling. At the Imperial Mae Ping Hotel, she had checked in as “Theresa Teng” using a Belize passport.</p>For the cause of death, Sumet listed, “<a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">asthma attack</span></a>”. He also later opined that she had probably died on the way to the hospital.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">News of the tragedy travelled fast. Reporters began descending on the Imperial Mae Ping that evening, and by the following day the lobby had become a scrum of news crews from Bangkok, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Some of them were asking, ‘Where is the butler?’ But my general manager told us not to talk to anyone,” says Praphan. Laying low, he replaced his everyday name tag, “Billy”, with one using his Thai name, Praphan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Quilery stayed on at the hotel for two nights following Teng’s death, then flew to Taiwan for what would become a state funeral, with more than 200,000 mourning fans paying tribute as she lay in state. The wake was second in scale to only that of Chiang Kai-shek.</p>We love her. I have seen many people cry. If I don’t keep her story, people will forget itPraphan “Billy” Boonsuk, former butler<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over the ensuing five years, Quilery returned to Chiang Mai every May 8 to commemorate his fiancée’s passing, says Praphan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">No autopsy was ever performed on Teng’s body, and for fans and conspiracists, this has remained a major source of controversy and blame.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Immediately after the accident, Quilery did not deny a request for an autopsy, he simply deferred it, writing instructions to the hospital, “Don’t touch the body. Just put her in the cool storage for tonight.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The next day Teng’s brothers arrived, and the family also decided against a postmortem examination. “We accepted the Thai hospital’s cause of death,” Frank Teng later explained.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though “asthma attack” has gone down as Teng’s official cause of death, Quilery later proposed that she may have actually suffered a heart attack precipitated by overuse of her inhaler.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/3a34483f-649e-4018-b9fa-eb75f3ca64d3_053825f6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2010, this theory was revived by a respiratory specialist at Beijing’s Chinese Academy of Engineering, Zhong Nanshan, who said he had learned from the Chiangmai Ram Hospital chief pathologist that in addition to her inhaler, Teng had been using various throat sprays, which, if overused, could precipitate irregular heartbeat or possibly more serious cardiac events.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Journalists, fans and web sleuths have also pointed to a bruise on the left side of Teng’s face, visible in a leaked photo of Teng’s body lying on a hospital stretcher. On its basis, many have accused Quilery of domestic abuse and even murder.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bruise was later explained, however, as resulting from either her fall or embalming procedures, which drain blood from the jugular vein and inject embalming fluid into the carotid artery, both accessed in the neck area where Teng’s bruising was seen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In any biography, it is often the inconsistencies which are the most revealing, as they have a way of poking through the facade and offering a glimpse of the more authentic person beneath.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the Teresa Teng story, her Chiang Mai years present just such a moth hole in the tapestry of her otherwise flawless and near-angelic life story. Perhaps this is why the city has remained such an enigmatic draw to her multitude of fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/80477042-dcd2-4363-aa2e-08d097cc18fb_5af1aa62.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before the pandemic, Teng’s suite in the Imperial Mae Ping Hotel was receiving 200 visitors a day, most of them Chinese, making it one of the more popular attractions memorialising the singer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2019, the hotel shut down for four years, owing to a takeover by Bangkok-based real estate group Asset World Corporation, renovations and then Covid-19. Rebranded as the InterContinental Chiang Mai The Mae Ping, it reopened in November last year and has now dedicated its entire top floor to Teng’s memory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’ve bubble wrapped Teng’s suite, so to speak, and built a Chinese restaurant around it,” says hotel general manager Peter Pottinga, as he ushers me in for a private tour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The suite is now accessed through a door at the back of the restaurant, a portal that allows one to step back in time and onto the weave of a 1990s patterned carpet (though in a restored version).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The furniture” – including a French style bidet – “is all original”, explains Pottinga. The visitor experience is now packaged with afternoon tea and the number of guests is controlled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/debc5218-5476-4683-a288-3c9ff64bc3a4_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Imperial Mae Ping’s 2019 shutdown was also when Praphan left the hotel after 29 years of service, opening his own memorial, which, a touch campy but extremely heartfelt, offers a similar afternoon tea concept.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We love her,” says the butler. “I have seen many people cry. If I don’t keep her story, people will forget it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Perhaps the most unusual feature of this final chapter in Teng’s life is that it relies on the memory of Thais, such as Praphan, who knew a Teresa different from the almost divine figure in the collective imagination of millions of Chinese fans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Chiang Mai, she had finally found love, with a foreigner, respite from the suffocating adoration of a Mandarin-speaking public, and a quieter, more private life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I didn’t feel like she was a big star,” says Praphan. “I felt like she was a friend.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOpaann12nsqKw0miYq6yZmLmme5JrbWppaWd8uLTArWSbraShsrN50pquZqyVp7K0rYytnKefo2Kxpq3ToWScoJmWu6h5zJqgZqyYlratrc2dZJqmlGK1sMOMrJ%2BeZZakwq%2BwjKWmr51dqbWmvsQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./erin-urb-and-ezra-miller.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Erin Urb and Ezra Miller</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./power-book-iv-force-season-1-finale-extra-long-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Season 1 Finale Is Extra Long</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
