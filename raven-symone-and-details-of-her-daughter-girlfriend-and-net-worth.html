Already at the age of two the talented actress began to appear on the screens and remained true to her passion. It was an interesting journey for the star, who owes her hard work for the celebrity status she enjoys. We’ve all seen Symone grow from daddy’s little girl on The Cosby Show to a teenager on That’s So Raven and a mother on Raven’s Home. Of course, these are just some of her popular works.</p><p>Given her popularity and influence, much about Raven was considered controversial. Issues concerning her personal life, sexuality and other aspirations have found their way into the media and created a controversial perception of the star in the minds of some of her fans. You can find out more by browsing through.</p><h2><strong>Who Exactly is Raven Symone?</strong></h2><p>Symone, who was born on December 10, 1985, as Raven-Symoné Christina Pearman, received all the support she needed to pursue her passion from her parents Lydia (Gaulden) and Christopher Pearman. Her first days in show business were when she signed with the New York Ford Models. Her entry into the world of television with The Cosby Show began with a significant note and was critically acclaimed for her role as Olivia Kendall, Dr. Cliff Huxtables (played by Cosby) step-granddaughter.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Tiffany Trump Wiki, Height, Mother, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Family</a></strong></p><p>Raven’s popularity grew when she starred in Hangin With Mr. Cooper in the 1990s. She also went to the movies and made quite an impression. After she starred in the popular Dr. Dolittle in 1998, Raven Symone’s fame increased by several inches. The role of the daughter of the main character Eddy Murphy in the fantasy comedy earned her much recognition in the industry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Raven-Symone-Bio.jpg><p>She resumed her role in the sequel in 2001, before making another big breakthrough in 2003 with That’s So Raven. The Disney series, in which she appeared as a teenager with psychic abilities, went down in history as one of the station’s longest series and brought her further to fame.</p><p>Symone returned in 2017 and played a sequel to That’s So Raven in Raven’s Home. This time she played as a young mother. The actress owes her revered status in the entertainment industry to the series The Raven and her film cache.</p><h2><strong>What Else is She Known For?</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Raven Symone</a> is also a singer, songwriter, and producer. The actress entered the world of music in 1993 when she released her first studio album, Here’s to New Dreams. She was seven years old at the time and was known for her That’s What Little Girls are Made Of single from the album.</p><p>Further albums like Undeniable 1999 and This is My Time 2004 followed, but were not as successful as her music from her That’s So Raven days. Some of Symone’s major musical breakthroughs came when she appeared on the show as a cast member.</p><p>Soundtracks such as The Cheetah Girls, That’s So Raven and several others made Raven a celebrity with millions of hits and big record sales. Raven was a part of the host of the popular American talk show The View for a year and was very important in the show.</p><h2><strong>Raven Symone’s Mindblowing Career Earnings</strong></h2><p>Whenever it comes to money talks about a celebrity like Raven Symone, Disney comes up with $400 million in revenues from the That’s So Raven series. As the main character in the series, Symone was considered by Ebony Magazine to be “$400 million girls,” a move that has confused many who believe the actress’s fortune is $400 million.</p><p>Raven Symone has promoted several brands in the past and continues to do so; this has contributed significantly to her enviable net worth, estimated at $55 million. How did she earn so much? Well, Disney’s That’s So Raven ran over 100 episodes and Symone reportedly earned an average of $30,000 per episode.</p><p>It may sound so huge, but you will be amazed at how much she earned with her music career. Raven’s hit tracks during her time with the That’s So Raven family were another big part of her financial success.</p><p>The Cheetah Girls’ popular soundtrack not only earned her numerous nominations but also earned her so much money and made her so influential. Raven’s numerous live performances and tours all contribute to her revered pedestal in the entertainment industry.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Grace Vanderwaal Bio Net Worth, Sister, Wiki, Parents, Family, Height</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Is She a Lesbian and Does She Have a Girlfriend?</strong></h2><p>If you have followed the actress, and also her professional career, you are probably aware of the controversies surrounding her sexuality and her private life in general. Raven Symone didn’t say anything about her sexual orientation in the ’90s, but she always gave people reason to think about it.</p><p>Only in the 2000s did the actress and singer gradually come out that she was gay. Raven not only confirmed that she was a lesbian but also announced that she was with a woman in 2014. Previously, Dr. Dolittle star was already in a romantic relationship with Empire star AzMarie Livingston. Only in 2015 did she publicly confirm that they were together.</p><p>This may have been due to pressure from the media and the public, but the two lovebirds separated the same year they went public. In 2015 they had been together for more than three years, but they decided to separate. In various interviews, Raven said that she gave up the relationship because she did not want to be labeled gay or identified by her sexual orientation.</p><h2><strong>Does Raven Symone Actually Have a Daughter?</strong></h2><p>She is not married and to the best of our knowledge not in a relationship, but Raven Symone more or less fits the status of a family woman and all thanks to the rumors that she has a daughter named Lilliana Pearman. It all started in 2009, there were rumors that Raven was pregnant and that Empire Cast member Jussie Smollet was responsible.</p><p>There was also a rumor that Smollet had donated his sperm to her. Whether the actress had a child or not is up to her, but recently there have been no reports of a child belonging to Raven.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kv6LCxKdkrLGdpLumecCnm2aclamuqrjSZqafZZiav26wwK6eoayVp3qotdGlnauhlaOxbq3NnWSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./salma-hayek-vision-elegant-red-leather-gown.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>See Salma Hayek Look Gorgeous in an Elegant Red Leather Gown</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./music-city-how-about-food-city-3-nashville-restaurants-show-why-tennessee-capital-top-dining.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Music City?
