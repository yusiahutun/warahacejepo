But what is a Brazilian blowout, exactly? And how does it make hair so miraculously shiny? To get the low down as we turn up the heat, we asked hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Jennifer Matos</a> of New York City's Rita Hazan Salon and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Jennifer Lord</a>, hairstylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Natural Hollywood</a>, to give us a crash course on the hair-straightening treatment.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for your cheat sheet on the Brazilian blowout and find out if it's the right treatment for you.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-brazilian-blowouts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Brazilian Blowouts?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Brazilian blowout hair treatment is a liquid keratin formula that bonds to your hair to create a protective layer around each strand, effectively diminishing frizz, sealing the cuticle, and protecting against any external damage. After applying the treatment, Lord says the hair is blow-dried, straightened, rinsed out, and blow-dried again. The heat causes the chemicals to activate and bond to the shaft.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The smoothing treatment originated in Brazil and uses ingredients indigenous to the country including camu camu, annatto seed, and açai berry. After getting the treatment, your hair will be left hydrated, less frizzy, and more resilient to heat styling — not to mention, with an insanely glossy mirror-like shine.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-is-a-brazilian-blowout-different-from-other-keratin-treatments></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Is a Brazilian Blowout Different From Other Keratin Treatments?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although both end results are similar, a Brazilian Blowout has a mild formula that can be tailored to your hair type and is a little less delicate post-treatment. "After you get a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>keratin treatment</a>, you don't have as many options," says Matos. "You can't tie it back in a ponytail or clip, you can't style it, and you can't wash it for the three or four days that follow. With the Brazilian blowout, you get it done, your stylist rinses it out, and that's it. You're back to your normal life again."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lord adds that it's also not quite as permanent as other treatments and can be completely customized to your hair and your wants.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-will-a-brazilian-blowout-make-my-hair-completely-straight></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Will a Brazilian Blowout Make My Hair Completely Straight?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not unless you want it to. Your stylist will seal in the treatment by passing a 450-degree flat iron over your hair, and the more your stylist flat irons, the straighter your hair will be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you like to wear your hair curly, but just want to tame your frizz, this will help make your hair smooth. Just be sure to tell your stylist exactly what you want, and they can tailor the treatment to either preserve the texture of your hair or make it smoother," Matos explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The overall goal is to make your strands less of a burden to work with, but keep in mind that if you have naturally curly hair, it won't air dry to a pin-straight texture. "You'll still have voluminous body with waves if you <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>air dry</a> it, but if it normally takes you 30 minutes with a blow dryer, this can help you cut down the time to just 15 minutes," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you do desire completely straight hair, again, be sure to inform your stylist. "It truly depends on the client's request," says Lord. "Your hair will be completely straight if you use the treatment for that purpose along with adding the proper amount of heat afterward."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-does-a-brazilian-blowout-last></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long Does a Brazilian Blowout Last?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Provided that you don't use shampoos that contain sulfates and chlorine, your treatment should last anywhere from three to four months — possibly longer if you don't need to wash your hair as regularly as some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once it wears off, your hair will return to its natural curl pattern. "You'll start to see it around the hairline first," Matos says. "That's your indicator of when it's time to get it redone." Even if you don't get it touched up right away, there's no obvious line of demarcation between the previously treated hair and new growth, unlike with other relaxing or straightening methods.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-does-a-brazilian-blowout-take></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long Does a Brazilian Blowout Take?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Overall, the process takes an hour to an hour and a half," Matos says. "The longest I've ever spent doing a Brazilian blowout was around two hours, so it all depends on how much hair you have and how thick it is."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your stylist will begin by shampooing your hair three or four times to remove all the product and create a base for the treatment to adhere. Working section by section, the Brazilian blowout formula will be applied from root to tip, then blow-dried smooth. A flat iron heated to 450 degrees will seal it in, then it's back to the shampoo bowl to rinse out the treatment, followed by a deep conditioning mask. Finally, your hair will once again be blow-dried smooth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Beauty School: How to Use a Round Brush for a Perfect Blowout</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-should-i-do-after-getting-the-brazilian-blowout-treatment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Should I Do After Getting the Brazilian Blowout Treatment?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike the post-keratin treatment routine, there aren't any restrictions as to what you can and can't do in terms of activity, so you won't have to skip out on your hot yoga class. Additionally, since the treatment is rinsed out in the salon, you can wait as long or as little as you'd like to wash it, but again, just be sure to use a sulfate- and chlorine-free formula to preserve it.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-brazilian-blowouts-safe></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are Brazilian Blowouts Safe?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Matos says the treatment is safe on most hair types, Lord warns that people with textured hair should take precautions because the treatment could potentially be damaging. She suggests being mindful of the amount of heat you're applying to textured strands because of the different ways certain parts of your hair may react.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The differences between hair strands on textured manes means that heat will hit one area more intensely than another causing damage and breakage," Lord says. "The impact of the first treatment may not be observed by the naked eye but it is very likely damage has been done by the formaldehyde in the [formula]."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The bottom line here is before throwing caution to the wind, you should consult your stylist to find out if a Brazilian blowout is safe for your hair. Sure, we all want smooth and shiny hair, but if it turns out to damage your strands in the long run, it's probably not worth it.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-you-get-a-brazilian-blowout-if-you-have-colored-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can You Get a Brazilian Blowout if You Have Colored Hair?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Brazilian blowout is typically safe on color-treated strands, says Matos. In fact, since it completely seals off the hair shaft, she says there's a chance your hair will stay vibrant for longer. "We've had clients who have gotten color done and followed it up with a Brazilian blowout in the same day, and that would be the perfect time to do it since the cuticle is already open from the color," Matos tells us. "If you're doing this, just be sure to let your colorist know since doing one treatment after the other can make the color a bit brighter."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-643a4d0e-3499-426f-8e7c-61d4d72f6f4b></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=45.762711864407><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-0.98><p><span class=accordion__title>Do all Brazilian Blowouts use formaldehyde?</span></p><p>Yes, Brazilian Blowouts and other hair straightening treatments typically use formaldehyde, notes the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>FDA</a>.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-0.85014409221902><p><span class=accordion__title>Is there a natural alternative to Brazilian Blowouts?</span></p><p>Natural hair straightening treatments will most likely not be as effective as a Brazilian blowout, however, there are alternatives.
