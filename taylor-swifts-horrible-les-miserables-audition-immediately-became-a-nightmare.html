The Love Story singer reminisced and explained it was “established” she was “there for a good time, not a long time.” This is despite her doing several auditions and screen tests – when producers film actors to see if they’re a good fit for their wanted role. Before then, she had a cameo role in Hannah Montana: The <a href=#>Movie</a>, so this would have been a big step-up for Tay Tay.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1474479307-1024x749.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-almost-starred-in-les-miserables-before-audition>Taylor Swift’s almost starred in Les Misérables before audition</h2><p>Taylor Swift called her early acting venture “a nightmare,” which is understandable when you realize the <a href=#>music</a> star had to meet the Fantastic Beasts star with fake brown teeth.</p><p>Her final screen test in London saw her dressed as Eponine (despite, as Swift explained, her having “more of a look of Cozette”) looking like a “street urchin” with her teeth stained brown. The 34-year-old said she wasn’t too happy as she wanted to meet Eddie for the first time out of costume.</p><p>“They were like, ‘Do you wanna come to London for a one last screen test and you get to screen test with Eddie Redmayne,'” she explained. “I’m like ‘This seems like an experience I wanna have in my life,’ so I was like ‘yeah I’ll go to London.'”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Taylor Swift ‘moved’ by single mom’s tearful story about her daughter</a></p><p>She continued: “I get there and they’re like ‘Okay so we really wanna make you look like Eponine’ – you know, she wasn’t like loaded [with money], she had brown teeth. I’m like ‘You’re going to do that after I meet Eddie Redmayne right?’ I get to meet people and then you do the brown teeth?”</p><p>Unfortunately for the almost-<a href=#>Hollywood</a> star, this was not the case.</p><p>“They’re like ‘No, no everybody’s gonna meet you with the brown teeth and we’re gonna do big circles under your eyes like you’re near death …</p><p>“I was like ‘This has immediately become a nightmare for me.'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-and-eddie-talk-about-their-first-meeting>Taylor and Eddie talk about their first meeting</h2><p>Eddie called his first meeting with Taylor Swift early into her acting career “hilarious,” and it turns out she wasn’t the only one feeling uncomfortable.</p><p>“You were so nice,” remembered Taylor, but said when she met him she spoke with her mouth almost closed.</p><p>“It was hilarious because you know, you walked in as a 19th-century street urchin and I was not expecting that,” said Eddie. “My overwhelming memory of it, Taylor, was I had just been to Pizza Express beforehand and I had some garlic dough balls.</p><p>“I thought we’d be singing off at each other but it was so weird because they had Taylor fully dressed as Eponine and I was in my tracksuit, and they had us on the floor singing sweet nothings at each other. And all I knew is I just had garlic breath.”</p><p>“And I had brown teeth,” joked Taylor.</p><p>“You were weeping and I just thought it was because of how I looked. It’s nice that you were also struggling in that moment,” she laughed.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift’s 2024 horoscope hints ‘marriage is in the cards’ for the first time in 12 years</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WCcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkoaeip7ajuMRmo56rXaK2tLHRmpmlnaNirrawyK2gqKZdnrquscOimK2dnK56o7HCmqSeZZFiu6qzx62kmqqVZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-ll-tell-one-awesome-tip-shocking-moment-denny-s-patron-rewards-waiter-sex-act-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Video shows a Denny's patron reward her waiter with a sex act</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./article-ed1c4820-2218-11ed-b3fd-531098fac0fa-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joseph Dalton Lovett | Obituaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
