In September 2020, the couple began dating, but by April 2022, they called it quits. The TikTok star admitted they split up because DYSN was acting like a kid, and she did not want to mother a grown-up man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Loren-Gray-Beechs-lovers.jpg><p>As of December 2022, Loren seems to be taking a break from dating life.

Like Gray, he is also a social media influencer. In addition, the former pair also had their own “couple Instagram,” called Joeyxloren. Unfortunately, the former duo broke up. Loren Gray’s ex-boyfriend stated that the pair broke up because they needed some time apart due to their busy lives.</p><p>After that, Loren dated <strong>Juwany Roman</strong> in 2016 and broke up the same year. Loren Gray’s former beau has a sizable following on Snapchat and is a social media influencer. On Twitter in 2016, Loren claimed that Rowan was very possessive and jealous, even when it wasn’t necessary, which was why their relationship ended.</p><p>Moreover,<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong> Ian Jeffrey</strong></a> and Loren Gray were romantically involved from the end of 2018 to March 2019. As the younger brother of <strong>James Charles</strong>, he is a prominent figure on social media. In December 2018, he disclosed their relationship. However, due&nbsp;to compatibility problems, the duo split up in March 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lorens_Rumored_Boyfriends></span>Loren’s Rumored Boyfriends<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The TikTok famous influencer had multiple past relationships. Having a remarkable career, Loren is not so shy about her dating life. While some of her relationships have been confirmed, she has been linked to many other guys.</p><p>Beech and <strong>Harvey Leigh Cantwell</strong>, popularly known as<strong> HRVY</strong>, were rumored to date back in 2017. The <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">rumors came</a> after they came together with an exclusive music video. Neither Loren nor HRVY addressed this rumor despite posting numerous cozy pictures and TikTok together. So whether the couple was together remained unknown.</p><p>Additionally, Loren was rumored to be dating <strong>Tayler Holder</strong> after they were seen holding hands together. However, Gray and Holder shut down these rumors through social media platforms saying they were shooting for a video. She further explained that she had a boyfriend, and they were very happy.</p><p>Futhermore, after breaking up with Kyle, there were rumors between Loren and <strong>Josh Richards</strong>, an influencer and CEO of CrossCheck Studios. On one of the BFF’s podcast episodes with <strong>Dave Portnoy</strong> and Josh Richards, Dave <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">asked Loren</a> and Josh to clarify recent rumors. However, neither of them elaborated further on their relationship status, So whether the duo is together remains a mystery.</p><p>Overall, the TikTok star doesn’t get shy about her dating life and seems very open about her relationships. We wish Loren the best for her future and hope she spills the tea regarding her love life.</p><p><strong>For<span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;More Updates On&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebrityMirror.</span></strong></a></p><strong>For More Updates on <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Articles</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Feuds</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Siblings</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Richest Celebrities</a>, Keep In Touch With <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcLjOq5ynZZenrrp5waiwn6qZmrulv44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shaved-asparagus-frittata-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>shaved asparagus frittata</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alexis-mabille-couture-spring-summer-2017.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alexis Mabille Couture Spring/Summer 2017</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
