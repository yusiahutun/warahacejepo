Let’s face it, not everyone is cut out to be a parent and can undertake the challenges that come with it. Some people just do not have the parental instincts or they are unable to put another person first, which is a cardinal rule of parenting. Once you have a child, you are no longer the most important person in the world.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hidden youth: societal pressure driving city’s young into apathy and reclusiveness</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In this day and age, there is no such thing as a typical family: a traditional nuclear family with two parents and children. There are many different types of families, such as single-parent ones, same-sex parents, transgender parents, and so on; the possibilities are endless.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">In this day and age, there is no such thing as a typical family: a traditional nuclear family with two parents and children</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, these poster-worthy nuclear families are often portrayed as the ideal happy family model. And it is sometimes said that children with one parent might grow up becoming a little unbalanced as opposed to those living with both biological parents. This is because some people want to hold on to the conventional view that a “broken” family might have a negative impact on the emotional well-being of the child, and consequently affect their mental development.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/13/57539f00-7528-11e9-933d-71f872cf659b_1320x770_155509.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are also adopted families with parents who take care of children who aren’t of their own blood, with no expectation of reward.

The common belief is that the father plays an important role in a child’s development and that his absence may increase the risk of behavioural problems. This belief has encouraged many wrongful stereotypes over the years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/13/617ab298-7528-11e9-933d-71f872cf659b_1320x770_155509.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In fact, in today’s world where there is so much fluidity in family make-up, by which you can have two fathers or two mothers in a same-sex marriage, or two sets of parents in reconstituted families where previously married couples set up families separately, there is really no need for a traditional set up of a mother and father. For example, in gay marriages, fixed roles are not needed as long as the parents have the best interests of the child at heart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/13/1b5d7498-7529-11e9-933d-71f872cf659b_1320x770_155509.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With this in mind, we should take to heart that a family is what one makes of it, and not all families are the same.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whatever the composition of your family, as long as the parents – or parent – is kind, loving, selfless, accepting, moral, and committed, then that is what a child really needs to feel safe, loved, and happy in the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Luisa Tam is a correspondent at the Post</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoqqibmZrBunvAq6uim5yafHR8j3Jwb2tfm66utcuinKxlk6S6pnnApaNmq5iWvaa%2FjJqlnWWjnsemv4ylpq%2BdXaiup7HTsmSappRiwKKv0aKdopuV</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wynn-resorts-casino-manhattan-tower-hotel-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wynn Resorts unveils renderings for colossal $12BILLION casino complex in Manhattan that features an</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ines-tazi-searches-for-her-next-love-on-perfect-match.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ines Tazi Searches For Her Next Love on Perfect Match</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
