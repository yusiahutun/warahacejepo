It could be that we are excited to experience the way other people live their lives – or that the concept is interesting, like Survivor. We can’t help but binge on episode after episode.</p><p>From main cast members to additional features, we tend to want to be kept in the loop with not just their lives as portrayed by the shows but their personal lives too.</p><p>One reality show star not exempt from fans poking around in his personal life is Marcel Cthulhu from Animal Planet’s Pitbulls and Parolees.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality star made a couple of appearances as a volunteer at the largest pit bull rescue center owned by show star Tia Torres. When he suddenly disappeared, fans kept asking what happened to Mariah and Marcel.</p><p>If you’ve searched up and down and wondered: what is Marcel from Pitbulls and Parolees doing now, here’s a breakdown of all you need to know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Pitbulls and Parolees?</h2><p><a href=#>The Animal Planet show</a>, Pitbulls and Parolees, follows<a href=# data-type=post data-id=2189> Tia Torres</a>, a mother, top pit bull trainer, and founder and owner of Villalobos Rescue Center, as she rehabilitates and retrains hundreds of pit bulls so that they can be placed in good homes. You would probably have figured from the show’s name that Pit Bulls aren’t the only center of attraction.&nbsp;</p><p>The series incorporates former prison inmates, making for one unique reality show. Want to know how it all fits in? Well, Tia Torres combines aggressive dogs, which have often been abused, with parolees who have often suffered trauma, teaching parolees how to train pit bulls and make them ready for adoption.&nbsp;</p><p>Torres aims to showcase her adventurous and admirable duty to animals to break the misconception of Pit Bulls being dangerous dogs (add in normally owned by gangs for a stereotype).</p><p>Although parolees displaying affection for a man’s best friend would be the center of attention on any given day, viewers are also intrigued by fellow castmates, including Tia’s daughters Tania and <a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Mariah Torres" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked href=#>Mariah Torres</a> and her two sons Kanani and Moe Torres.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from having a front seat to the show’s animal rescue stories, viewers see love develop between cast members, such as when Mariah falls in love with Marcel Cthulhu, a volunteer at the rescue center. Fans of the show would know that Marcel was free-spirited and was ready to risk his life for dogs, like when he went into an apartment with fire ants to rescue some puppies.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s quite easy to see how Mariah fell in love with Marcel, a kind-hearted person who shared many things in common with the reality star. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Cinemaholic</a>, the two eventually got married in Vegas in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>When Marcel started to appear fewer times on the show and eventually not at all, fans became concerned about their whirlwind romance. Unfortunately, fans were quickly brought up to speed by the devastating news that their union fell apart.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened to Marcel and Mariah?</h2><p>The two animal lovers bonded over their special connection to dogs and fans thought it was nearly impossible for them to part ways. However, after just a couple of months of being a married couple, their marriage broke apart as quickly as it came together. Their divorce was finalized in 2018, and it’s safe to assume things weren’t as great as they seemed.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, fans were curious to learn more about the events that led up to their divorce and kept questioning the reality star on her social media pages about why they could no longer stick it out.&nbsp;</p><p>Mariah, who is usually tight-lipped about her personal life, responded to fans’ comments on Instagram, revealing that although their divorce was finalized in 2018, their marriage had been heading for failure as soon as a couple of months after they tied the knot. It appears the reason for their split, as per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nicki Swift</a>, was that they realized they “wanted different things.”&nbsp;</p><p>As per The Cinemaholic, there is no bad blood between the two, with the reality stars supposedly still being friends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mariah Early Life and Lesbian claims&nbsp;</h2><p>Mariah Torres was born in California, United States, and raised by her mom Tia Torres and stepfather, Arena Marcus Jackson. Not much information is known about her biological father. Appearing a little rough around the edges, it might surprise you to know that Mariah was interested in beauty pageants from a young age, participating in various pageants from age 11.&nbsp;</p><p>According to reports, Mariah completed her high school education but wasn’t as keen on going to college. Instead, she vouched to help out at the Villalobos Pitbull rescue center.&nbsp;</p><p>After spending some time working at the center, she began her career in television when producers approached her mom to feature in a show surrounding their daily lives rescuing pit bulls. Apart from what fans know about Mariah from watching her on the reality series, Mariah is not one to reveal much about her personal life.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as her love life over the years is concerned, we know that Mariah was engaged to girlfriend Florencia Carcagno in 2012, but of course, that fell through, and she married Marcel. Based on her past relationships, Mariah is seemingly bisexual. However, she has mentioned not wanting to put tags on herself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Marcel Doing Now?</h2><p>After featuring in a batch of episodes on the animal-centric reality series, Marcel undoubtedly caught viewers’ attention; fans loved seeing his great personality and genuine affection for animals.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, for fans who wanted to keep up to date with his whereabouts even after leaving the show, he doesn’t have any social media accounts, so it’s pretty hard to keep a tag on the once-reality star.&nbsp;</p><p>We assume that he probably still works with animals as the show exhibited his immense passion for them. Wherever he may be, we hope Marcel from Pitbulls and Parolees has been able to move past Mariah and lead a good life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCRqXqprc%2BpnKedlGLBsHnMmqmcnZxisLW01KWfrmWfo3qxtdObrKWko2Kur7CMqZirp5yasrR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-french-cant-smell-roses-masks-bloom-among-flowers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why the French cant smell the roses: masks bloom among the flowers in perfume capital</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tommy-winkler.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tommy Winkler</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
