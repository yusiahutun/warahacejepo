He believes Meghan Markle’s dreams of Hollywood are down to the Duke of Sussex.</strong></p><p>Richard Kay, who was a friend of the Princess of Wales, says that<a href=#> Prince Harry</a> is holding back Meghan Markle when it comes to her return to acting. Rumors of the Duchess wanting to break back into showbiz have been swirling for some time. However, it could be her husband and his <a href=#>royal</a> family across the pond that makes it a bigger issue than both could have predicted.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-dreams-of-hollywood-is-down-to-prince-harry>Meghan Markle dreams of Hollywood is down to Prince Harry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-170715915-819x1024.jpg><p>When the star joined the royal family and married her husband in 2018, she had already wrapped up her time on Suits. <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> had left behind her career in <a href=#>Hollywood</a> when she said the words ‘I do’.</p><p>Richard Kay says the reason she hasn’t entered back into the spotlight is because of her husband. GB News <a href=# rel=nofollow>reported</a> on his comments and discussed them with Kinsey Schofield, a royal commentator and showbiz journalist.</p><p>Schofield said: “This is a great point made by one of <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>‘s closest friends, towards the end of her life. His name is Richard Kay, and he told Palace Confidential that the only thing standing in Meghan [Markle]’s way of her big Hollywood comeback is Prince Harry.”</p><p><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>Meghan Markle is ‘watching Taylor Swift’ to reap her own benefits</a></p><p>She continued that it wasn’t just her acting that was impacted.&nbsp;</p><p>“He says it’s harder for Meghan to launch her new career objectives amidst all of the royal rift headlines,” Kinsey added. “And again, with all of this litigation, it’s hard for Meghan to come out full force trying to promote the TIG. Everybody wants to focus on the relationship with Harry’s family.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-negative-publicity>Negative publicity</h2><p>The negative press coverage that Schofield may be referring to is the fact that Harry and Meghan were rumored to have snubbed the King’s invite to his 75th birthday celebrations. However, that was later denied by the couple, who say <a href=#>they were actually never invited in the first place.</a></p><p>A spokesperson for the Sussexes told the MailOnline: &nbsp;“There has been no contact regarding an invitation to His Majesty’s upcoming birthday. It is disappointing The Sunday Times&nbsp;has misreported this story.”</p><p>A source further said: “They had not received any invitation and were unaware of any celebrations until the stories came out. I’m sure the Duke will find a way to reach out privately to wish His Majesty a happy birthday like he has always done.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-charles-deeply-hurt-by-harry-s-actions>King Charles “deeply hurt” by Harry’s actions</h2><p>Sources say that Harry’s actions of <a href=#>snubbing the invitation</a> have “lasting effects” on the head royal.</p><p>A source said: “When he gets to the end of another successful work day and thinks of his family, there will always be a twinge in his heart about a problem he hasn’t been able to solve yet,” the insider offered, talking about the lasting effects.”</p><p>However, they continued: “There is the sense of a cooling-off period from the family that is under way after the aftershocks of the book and interviews. But that doesn’t change the King’s love for his son.</p><p>“He’ll never not invite his son to a family gathering, because that’s not who he is.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>King Charles’ four words before Diana marriage that may have predicted tragic fate</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aBcLvNpbBmrJieu6h50q2mqaiZo7RuucSgn5qmXaKus7fLnqpmoJ%2BhubrDzqibZpuforKjrcKkZKKrXaW%2FqrrCnmShmaKnxnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./280838-rongo-university-college-fee-structure-courses-offered-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rongo university college fee structure &amp;amp; courses offered</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lauren-alaina-next-boyfriend-football-player-dancing-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lauren Alaina Finds Her Next Boyfriend + He's Way Into It</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
