Perhaps you disagree with eBay’s business practices, or have gotten one too many shoddy deals. Or maybe you’re a seller who’s just fed up with having to pay so much for eBay’s services.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Regardless as to your reasons why, there are plenty of eBay alternatives out there. Many function better than eBay itself does. So, without further ado, here are six of the very best for you to consider.</p><h2 id=craigslist>1. <a href=#>Craigslist</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Craigslist-Landing-Page-Screenshot.jpg><p>Founded in 1995, Craigslist is the first entry onto this list, and for good reason. Craigslist is an online classified website, and the largest current community for posting classified ads. It exists for a wide range of different countries and communities, which means that you’ll always be able to find a buyer, no matter where you go.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Unlike eBay, Craigslist doesn’t charge any fees to list or sell your items. The jobs get handled locally and face-to-face, which means that, unlike eBay, there’s no safety net if you purchase something and get scammed.</p><p>Craigslist’s interface design hasn’t changed much since 1995, either, which can make it a little difficult to navigate through at times. With that being said, once you figure out <a href=#>how to search all of Craigslist from any device</a>, you’ll be able to find a wealth of opportunities.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>With that being said, if you prefer to sell items locally or cash in hand, Craigslist is a great option to do so. Just don’t expect to reach an international audience like you might with eBay.</p><h2 id=bonanza>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bonanza</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Bonanza-Landing-Page-Screenshot.jpg><p>Compared to some of the other entries onto this list, Bonanza is relatively new to the scene. With that being said, there’s also a lot to like.</p><p>Unlike eBay, Bonanza operates from a fixed-price system, rather than eBay’s auction-based marketplace. This means that you’ll be selling and buying items at the price they get listed at.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>What makes Bonanza truly unique, however, is how there is no listing price. Instead, there is only a commission that gets charged when an item is sold. This means that you can freely list a considerable range of items without any fear of losing money.</p><p>Moreover, Bonanza automatically sends item listings to both Google and Bing as a form of advertising that is included in its service. This means that your odds of sale are higher than they might be with eBay.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=ebid>3. <a href=#>eBid</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/eBid-Landing-Page-Screenshot.jpg><p>If you’re looking for a pretty direct alternative to eBay, then eBid is a pretty solid choice. Even just looking at the name itself makes it pretty clear that eBid takes a lot of inspiration from its competitor.</p><p>So, how does it differ? eBid, like eBay, uses an auction-style format for its product listings, which means making the switch from one to the other a pretty easy thing to do. Unlike eBay, however, eBid has noticeably lower listing fees and commission charged per sale.</p><p>The trade-off here is that eBid has noticeably fewer users than you’ll find on eBay. This means that it’s harder to find a great deal than on eBay, and if you’re trying to sell something unique, then you’re less likely to reach your intended audience.</p><h2 id=etsy>4. <a href=#>Etsy</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Etsy-Landing-Page-Screenshot.jpg><p>For those of you who are looking to sell something homemade or vintage, then Etsy is potentially the best marketplace to do exactly that. Founded in 2005, Etsy is now one of the largest online communities for selling these types of items.</p><p>Obviously, this means that Etsy can’t be directly compared to eBay. If you’re trying to sell anything that falls outside of Etsy’s niche, then there are better alternatives on this list for you. If, however, you’re trying to sell hand-made crafts, jewelry, vintage items, and more, then Etsy can certainly compete.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>But <a href=#>how does selling on Etsy work</a>? The fees for listing items are noticeably lower than with eBay, as is the commission, which is fixed. Etsy listings also last longer than they do with eBay.</p><p>It is worth mentioning, however, that Etsy is not an auction site, but focuses instead on direct sales. If you have a one-off item that you’re looking to sell or hoping to start a bidding war, then Etsy may not be the site for you.</p><h2 id=ecrater>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eCRATER</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/eCRATER-Landing-Page-Screenshot.jpg><p>If you’re looking to dip your toe into selling online but have been turned off by eBay’s listing fees, then eCRATER might just be the best solution for you.</p><p>Unlike eBay, eCRATER functions entirely for free. You can open up a store without any overhead, and eCRATER won’t even charge you if you bring in sales through your own marketing. There is still a commission on sales brought in through the eCRATER service, however.</p><p>The traffic here will no doubt be lower than it would be on eBay, but if you’re just getting started and looking for a no-risk or no-cost solution, then eCRATER is a great way to get started.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=ruby-lane>6. <a href=#>Ruby Lane</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ruby-Lane-Landing-Page-Screenshot.jpg><p>Finally, we have Ruby Lane. If you’re looking to buy or sell high-end antiques, art, or vintage collectibles, then Ruby Lane might just be what you’re looking for.</p><p>Unlike eBay, Ruby Lane functions now as an online auction house, but rather as a fixed-price marketplace. It’s filled with thousands of independent shops run by individual sellers, and has an international reach.</p><p>If you’re planning to sell with Ruby Lane, it’s important to understand that the payment structure is different than eBay’s. There is no commission rate of any kind, and the price per listing is quite low. However, Ruby Lane requires a sliding fee based on the size of your shop as well as an initial set-up fee.</p><p>As such, sellers function more like shops than they might with eBay, with less risk of you being scammed. As the items up for sale are also more niche than with eBay, the site gets used by more dedicated buyers. This means you may also be able to make a larger profit with your sales than you would off of someone scouring eBay for a bargain.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=find-the-perfect-marketplace-for-you>Find the Perfect Marketplace for You</h2><p>As you can see, there are a ton of different alternatives to eBay out there. If you’re looking to just give something free a try, or are hoping to start up a lucrative new business, there’s an option there for you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fm7KledSpZLChpJ16pq7AsmShnaKaeqK%2BxGaqqKWVYsSwvtOhsGaZnpl6pLTEmqeeql2WubWx0aeYraGmmsBuss6rZKydnKGys7%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./forget-machu-picchu-salt-ponds-maras-are-perus-go-attraction.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Forget Machu Picchu, the salt ponds of Maras are Peru's go-to attraction</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mississippi-cheese-straw-factory-sea-salt-caramel-cookie-straws.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mississippi Cheese Straw Factory Sea Salt Caramel Cookie Straws Laurel Mercantile</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
