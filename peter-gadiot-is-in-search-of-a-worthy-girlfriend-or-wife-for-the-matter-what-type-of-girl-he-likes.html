He recently won an Imagen award for Best supporting actor in a television series for his performance on the show.</p><p>While his professional life is an open book for us, Peter's personal life is quite mysterious. He never prefers to disclose his dating life out in public. So, is he hiding his affair from us? What is his relationship status? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is The Relationship Status Of Peter Gadiot? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Peter Gadiot is undoubtedly one of the hottest actors of our generation and everyone can't help but fall in love with him. So, is there someone special in his life?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, as&nbsp;of now, the actor is reportedly single and is just focused on his work. We saw him, recently, in an American superhero action-adventure series Supergirl as Mister Mxyzptlk. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/12/rsz6fe1ab006115e4ddbdd933d233b3fb04.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>The TV star, Peter Gadiot.</strong></p><p>Peter Gadiot never talked about his girlfriend in the public, He was once linked with a mysterious girl. He posted an image of a heart made of stone which seems that he's definitely interested in love and relationships.</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>This heart of stone has a story! After summiting I spot something- buried in a pile of stones, untouched on that remote mountain for perhaps millions of years, 3000M high, was this rock. Cracked & shaped by the forces of nature over time & forming a near perfect #heart. I thought it was a beautiful miracle. I had to take it home with me. To my partners bemusement I put the heavy rock in my pack. Two hrs later I say “Stop! Listen.” The faintest voice is there in the wind. “Help! Help! Come back!” We look at each other. Shit. I shout “We’re coming!” We turn & climb back up. A solo climber we met earlier fell a nasty vertical drop, hit a ledge & stopped just short of the precipice. His leg was badly broken. There’s no way he could move or that we could move him. We were three days hike from the nearest dirt road. Fortunately we have a satellite phone & call in the emergency. We layered up and waited. But then the weather began to turn. I watched the blue sky disappear and the clouds swirl & encircle us. The visibility reduced to nothing. Bad news. Hidden in the whiteout. Hours pass & the sun dips behind the rocky spine throwing us into shade. The temperature drops. I started to prepare for a night exposed on the mountain. Then we hear the familiar chugging of helicopter rotors. There’s a break in the cloud. We spot it. But it can’t see us. Tiny specs on the giant peak. At last we are sighted, a man winches down, the injured climber is stabilized and flown straight of the ledge, hanging below the chopper. They vanish, the sound fades to silence, until it’s just us, darkness closing in, still 6 hours climb to camp. We made it back, he didn’t, but he lives to fight another day. He was lucky I heard his cry for help. A bit later or if the wind was up, his voice would’ve been drowned out and he’d be up there alone. And the stone heart? I took it out to access my pack in the rescue. Then after, with our need to get to safety, I forgot it. I was so sad when I realized I left it! But, the reason I don’t have it is because we returned to help someone in need. I left my heart on the mountain to help save someone’s life. What else are hearts for right? To give love</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# rel=noopener>Peter Gadiot</a> (@petergadiot) on Jan 16, 2018 at 5:04pm PST</p><p>Though back in 2014 during a Q&A with his fans, Peter revealed his intention of having a girlfriend of his own soon.
