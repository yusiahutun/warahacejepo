replacement for real life sex but a separate standalone sexual experience in itself.</p><p>"We don't just see ourselves as a sex toy company but as helping bring about fundamental societal change which is why we decided to start renting our&nbsp;dolls&nbsp;out, giving millions of people across the world a chance to be part of this revolution."</p><p>Everything from bust size, to back and bum

sex&nbsp;dolls&nbsp;into the country's public imagination.</p><p>"At the moment a lot of the people who have agreed to have a&nbsp;doll&nbsp;of theirs on the market are part of the adult entertainment industry because they are a more open market but it wont be long before mainstream celebrities get in on the act when they realise sex&nbsp;dolls&nbsp;are here to stay.</p><p>"Newsreaders, politicians and anyone with a public profile will have their own&nbsp;doll&nbsp;for sale in a few years time."</p><p>The company's next area of focus is striking franchise deals across the globe, seeking partners
