The whole point of Matter is to bring smart home setup and management beyond the realm of hobbyists and home automation geeks---like yours truly---and make it easy enough for anybody to set up, even if they don't want to be an amateur smart home engineer.</p><p>So you don't necessarily need to have an advanced knowledge of the inner workings of the Matter to use it. But knowing the different terms for the core components of the Matter smart home ecosystem will help you assess the current layout of your smart home and plan for future upgrades and improvements.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Get Ready for Matter With a New Smart Home Display, Speaker, or Router</a></span></p><p>And if you're just getting started building your smart home, now is a perfect time to learn these concepts and have them in mind as you shop for the building blocks of your system.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of that, do check out <a href=# related-single>Related: </a><a href=#>Get Ready for Matter With a New Smart Home Display, Speaker, or Router</a>">these Matter update-ready devices to get a jump start on preparing your home for Matter.</p><h2 id=the-different-components-of-your-matter-smart-home-network>The Different Components of Your Matter Smart Home Network</h2><p>Like every other network in your home, from your Wi-Fi network and your wireless devices to your DVR and its satellite receivers, your Matter smart home is made up of individual components.</p><p>Let's take a look at the core device types that make up a Matter smart home. Before we dive in, however, take a moment to study this diagram from the Thread Group.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MatterTerminology1.jpg><p>The diagram does an excellent job cleanly laying out the topography of a smart home running a combination of all of the devices we're about to discuss and is a great visual reference.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=matter-devices>Matter Devices</h3><p>The most fundamental piece of your Matter smart home is all the individual Matter-compatible devices.</p><p>A Matter device, also called a Mattery accessory device, is simply any device that has the appropriate hardware and firmware to establish itself as a node in your Matter network.</p><p>Simple devices like a Matter-compatible smart plug or a Matter-compatible smart switch are just Matter devices and no more---which is fine because the more advanced functionality is handled by the other devices listed below.</p><p>Also, it's worth noting that just because you can control a device using Matter doesn't mean that the device itself is a Matter device. That might sound a bit confusing and counter-intuitive, but thanks to Matter bridge, which we'll talk about in a moment, you can control smart home devices that aren't, themselves individually, Matter compatible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In short, a Matter device is any piece of hardware that directly communicates with your local Matter network but doesn't, necessarily, do any heavy lifting beyond that.</p><h3 id=matter-controllers>Matter Controllers</h3><p>Matter is a local network within your home like Wi-Fi. Matter is an IP-based protocol and Matter devices can connect to each other over Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and Thread.</p><p>A Matter controller is a Matter device that has the additional ability to serve as connection between your local network and the greater Internet, allowing for remote access to your Matter devices.</p><p>The term "controller" hasn't quite caught on yet, and you'll often hear the term "hub" used to describe devices that can function as Matter controllers simply because of the prominence of the word in the smart home community.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/41t6qphm7hl-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Echo Dot (4th Generation)</h5><p class=display-card-description>The Echo Dot and other Echo smart speakers will receive and update to serve as Matter controllers.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><p>A key detail about Matter controllers is that they can only connect Wi-Fi and Ethernet-based devices to the Internet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quite a few devices like smart home speakers and displays from Google and Amazon will receive software updates to enable them to be Matter controllers, as well as some dedicated smart home hubs like SmartThings.</p><p>Do note that if a particular device has remote capability independent of Matter (such as a Wi-Fi smart plug with cloud support provided by the manufacturer), you will still be able to control it remotely even without a Matter controller. Matter and whatever first-party functionality provided by the manufacturer exists in parallel.</p><h3 id=matter-bridges>Matter Bridges</h3><p>A Matter bridge is a device that connects another smart home ecosystem to your Matter smart home. For example, the Philips Hue Hub, the heart of the Philips Hue smart lighting experience, is slated to receive an update that will make it Matter compatible.</p><p>This will make the Hue Hub a Matter bridge that links the extensive array of Hue lights and accessories into the Matter ecosystem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/41ivzvl9zzl-_sl500_-1.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Philips Hue Starter Kit</h5>$139 <span class=regular-price>$180</span> Save $41<p class=display-card-description>Individual Hue bulbs aren't Matter compatible, but thanks to the Huge Bridge they will be.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$139 at Amazon</a><p>None of the individual lights and accessories on their own will become Matter compatible, but through the bridge, they will happily play along with the rest of your Matter gear.</p><p>Bridges will serve a very important role in Matter smart home and its widespread adoption, as they will allow you to bring in any collection of smart home gear under the sun into the Matter ecosystem.</p><h3 id=matter-thread-border-routers>Matter Thread Border Routers</h3><p>A key component of Matter is Thread, a low-power IP-based communication protocol that uses the same frequency Zigbee smart home devices.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is a Thread Border Router?

As of October 2022, these are the <a href=#>devices on the market that are ready for an update to become Matter Thread border routers</a>.</p><p>Many devices that are Matter Thread border routers are also referred to as "Matter hubs" because, more so even than Matter controllers, they often fulfill the functions we normally think of when we think of smart hubs like linking multiple networks together, controlling devices, and in the case of products like the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Google Nest Hub</a>, even offering an on-device interface to control the smart home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a little terminology under your belt and a better understanding of how all your current smart home gear (and future purchases) will play together, you can ensure you're ready for Matter with all the right pieces in place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhvbHBjbIRwucCtq56qXZrFsbjAoqWenF2YvK%2FA0aijpZ2iqHqjvsidnp6rXZe8s7DEq2Srp6WpsrO%2FjJqlnWWdpL%2Bmew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nancy-putkoski.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nancy Putkoski - Age, Height, Career, Net Worth, Nationality, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bath-body-works-valentine-gifts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Valentine's Gifts From Bath &amp;amp; Body Works, For Your Beau or Your Bestie</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
