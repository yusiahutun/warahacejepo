Posting the picture, he reminded his followers to wish all the amazing women in their life a happy women's day. He wrote,&nbsp;</p><p>"Today is the day to give an extra smile and hug to your wives, girlfriends, mothers, sisters, grandmothers, daughters and all the other amazing women in your life!<br>Happy Women's day!"</p><p>Surely the Basketball star did not miss to wish his wife on the occasion or his girlfriend ... or a special someone. Honestly, we don't know if Bojan has a special someone in his life as he has kept the details pretty concealed.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>However, we know that his wife or partner will surely be a lucky one who will be showered with utmost appreciation and respect every day.&nbsp;</p><p>But it is no new news that&nbsp;Bogdanovic&nbsp;did have someone in his life. As per a report by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NBC Sports</a>, the former Brooklyn Nets player had gone on a vacation with his girlfriend to the Turkish coastal resort area of the Bodrum Peninsula.&nbsp;</p><p>It is unknown whether the two are still dating or not. Nuff' with women in his life, let's talk about men in his life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Through the grapevines, it has been reported that Bojan also has a brother who is in the same career field as him.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Another Utah Jazz Player</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Utah Jazz's George Hill Out On The Game With Nuggets Because Of His Injury!

But, like Bojan, Bogdan is also a professional NBA&nbsp;player, and well, if it isn't apparent, the two share the same surname and similar name.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>So popping the big question, are Bojan and Bogdan BogdanoviÄ‡ brothers? They actually are! Basketball brothers.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>But not brothers from the same mother. The two might be rumored to be brothers, but in reality, they are not related to each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Bogdan is a Serbian professional basketball player, and Bojan is from Croatia. However, Bojan's life is filled with extreme happiness as he is surrounded by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">three amazing sisters</a>, Ivana, Martina, and Karla, with whom he seems to be extremely close.&nbsp;</p><p>The Croatian Basketball player's life indeed is amazing; from a fruitful and successful career to happy family life, BogdanoviÄ‡ has it all! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>More On Bojan Bogdanovic</h2><p>Born on 18th April 1989, Bojan stands at the height of 6feet 7 inches.

Unfortunately, however, Bojan has several injuries on his record.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fox Sports</a> has recorded the 32-year-old to have had six injuries to date. His first was sprained left ankle, followed by a right wrist injury in 2020, and recently he sat down from the match in October of 27, 2021, due to an illness.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite these injuries, Bogdanovic&nbsp;never cares to step down from getting into the court and always returns with the same passion and determination as he always has.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunC8jpumo5meYq%2Bws8OapaiumWKvs7vToZyrZaees6Z51qKiomaYqbqt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amazon-alexa-streamline-morning-routine.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Streamline Your Morning Routine With Amazon Alexa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pregnancy-safe-skincare-guide.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Definitive Guide to Pregnancy-Safe Skincare</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
