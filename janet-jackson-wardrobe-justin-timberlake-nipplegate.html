She also alleged that when Timberlake arrived at the stadium the day of the performance, he was whisked to her dressing room to speak with Janet and Wayne for "a small conversation that lasted minutes," without any producers around.</p><p>"My instincts told me that there was a private conversation between wardrobe stylists and artists where someone thought this would be a good idea and it backfired," she added.</p><p>While Lukas didn't appear in the doc, he told "Access Hollywood" he was asked to participate and declined because Janet asked him to turn it down. Claiming he recently received death threats, he decided to speak with Access and share his side of the story.</p><p>"I was a work for hire, I was hired to do a job and I did exactly what I was supposed to do," he told the publication. "If I work with someone who's a dancer, you have to be able to dance in a wardrobe and it has to never fall apart. I stand 100% by my story that I did exactly what I was supposed to do, what I was hired for and if I ever hurt my friend, I wouldn't have worked with Janet for six years after the Super Bowl. I would have been fired that day."</p><p>As for what went wrong, he put the blame on producers for not cutting the cameras to black before her bare breast was shown on television.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8e65ec48-5fe2-4ba7-9359-1734b501e2e2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:44ad2b79-ecf8-4fa8-82aa-ee1c4f78f456 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/77/5by4/2021/11/18/7718d252a07346fc91b4f1d7af76f464_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Insiders Detail What Really Happened During Nipplegate Fiasco In New York Times Doc -- Biggest Bombshells Revealed!</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"You were never supposed to see a movement where a breast was out, a body part was out. It was never supposed to be lingering on something that they say was this terrible thing for such a long time. They were supposed to cut to black," he alleged. "You were supposed to get the idea of, 'I'm gonna have you naked by the end of this song,' nobody was supposed to be naked. And I've never said that. Somebody didn't push the button. Somebody didn't protect my friend."</p><p>Fatttini adamantly denied this account, telling Access, "This is a false statement as per all of my comments previously written and now broadcast."</p><p>Wayne said he and Timberlake "haven't spoken since he blamed me" for everything that went down. "[He] came off the stage and said, 'it's just a little wardrobe malfunction, we all want to give you something to think about.' He coined that phrase," said the stylist, "And when he said that I thought 'friendship over.'"</p><p>"Wardrobe malfunction? I don't malfunction," he added. "I was a professional stylist, $10,000 a day back then. I can't fail."</p><p>Lukas added that he has spoken with Jackson since the documentary aired and she allegedly told him not to speak with the press. "Lukas don't talk to anybody, just let this go. We're gonna handle this in January, I'm going to talk about this in January," he said she claimed, likely referring to her upcoming A&E documentary, "Janet," which drops January 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGpma2tfn66vsdNmoZqbm6i8r3nWmqmdqp%2BXsm621KyroqZdqbaursSro5qjlWK7qrzPpZygmaSafA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./towanda-braxton-wiki-net-worth-husband-divorce-height-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Towanda Braxton Wiki, Net Worth, Husband, Divorce, Height</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-fix-drifting-nintendo-switch-pro-controller.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Fix Your Drifting Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
