She became famous as a member of a comedy troupe, whose works have received great acclaim. She soon gained more popularity than any other member of the group, however, as her hard work and creativity were noticed and loved by fans.</p><p>Since becoming famous, Mallory Everton has never failed to delight fans with comedy sketches she writes for Studio C. If you are still wondering what the lady is up to right now and why she keeps her private life top-secret, read on for the juicy details.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Mallory Everton Biography</strong></h2><p>Mallory was born in Portland, Oregon on September 20, 1989, the son of the father, Bob Everton, and the mother and Collen Everton. She has five siblings and is the youngest of them. She attended Liberty High School, where she was valedictorian, and grew up in a Christian home where she attended the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p><p>Mallory Everton studied at Brigham Young University and graduated in 2012 with a degree in Media Arts with a focus on screenwriting, editing, and directing. Although she intended to become a doctor, she was awarded a scholarship from the Ray and Tye Noorda Foundation for her outstanding achievements and majestic works in the arts. This changed her career path when she promptly moved into the world of entertainment.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Lady Gaga’s Complete Dating History – Who Has Lady Gaga Dated?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Mallory is an actress, songwriter, and director; she has been working as a comedian in Studio C since 2012. She confirmed that she has always had a flair for acting, especially since she remembers shooting a commercial parody with her good friend Whitney when she was 9 years old.</p><p>Her love for acting and comedy began a long time ago when she and her siblings saw shows like Saturday Night Live, Dumb and Dumber, and Tommy Boy. Then, at the age of 19, she auditioned for the Divine Comedy troupe, a humor group at BYU.</p><p>She had started with the group as a videographer, but later she appeared as an oversized dance teacher and performed a routine. She worked so hard to look good in the fat suit her mother had made for the role and eventually ate Oreos to lose weight. She grew with the group and was there when she finally changed her name and became known as Studio C. She became an important part of the group’s writing team.</p><p>Two of her most celebrated comedic works for the group are Facebook Friends Song and Everything Sounds Nicer When You Sing, for which she said she was inspired by pop dance music.</p><p>She still grew with the group and directed the parody The Hungry Games as part of the series ‘Pretty Darn Funny’.</p><p>Mallory Everton, who plays guitar and has exceptional dancing skills, made her film debut in 2017 in the comedy We Love You, Sally Carmichael. Other comedies she has starred in include Queen Frostine, Captain Irony, Lady Shadow, Katniss Everdeen, Yellow, Minerva McGonagall, The Worst Kindergarten Teacher Ever, The Princess, The Peasant of the Welcome Mat, and Thor.</p><p>Her comedy track Studio C has over 1.5 million subscribers and about 55 million hits on YouTube. On Facebook alone, she has about 15,000 fans. For all her efforts so far, Mallory Everton has an estimated net worth of $500,000.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who is Nick Scarpino? His Wife And Other Facts You Need To Know</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Mallory Everton Married, Who is Her Husband or Boyfriend?</strong></h2><p>Mallory leads a rather private life and does not disclose details about her relationships and affairs. To the best of our knowledge, however, she is not married, although rumors about her relationship with Matt Reese, a former Studio C actor, are circulating.</p><p>Some of her colleagues have commented on her very close relationship with Matt, and since he is a former member of the Studio C team, we are tempted to believe that the two are an issue. In an interview, Mallory once said that the funniest scene she ever had with the team was when she was supposed to carry Matt off the stage, but she rolled her ankles in her heels and fell beside him.</p><p>We’re keeping our fingers crossed for her and hope that the two of them will speak up soon and spare us all speculation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuqK4y6ipsmWVq7KzwM6nZJuhn5y%2ForzHsmSiq12otaZ5zJqpq6GVmXq4tM5moKxlmJq%2FbrTUrJmappRivLN5waiwn6qZmrulew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./moline-native-is-new-mercado-executive-director.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Moline native is new Mercado executive director</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kristin-cavallari-shows-toned-frame-scintillating-bra-shorts-new-black-friday-videos-clothing-company-uncommon-james-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kristin Cavallari shows off her toned frame in scintillating bra and shorts in new Black Friday vide</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
