Goalkeeper Drake Callender came charging out of his box to head clear, only to completely misjudge the bounce and miss it.</p><p>Montreal striker Matias Coccaro raced in and briefly had an open goal to aim at on his left foot, but instead cut back onto his right. That allowed Miami time to recover and after multiple touches, his right-footed effort was ultimately blocked for a corner.</p><p>After the MLS social media account uploaded a video of the moment, it was quickly lambasted by fans online.
