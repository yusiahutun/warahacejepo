Learn how to capitalize on market trends with strategic guidance from this leading expert.</p><p>It may be discouraging for investors when international equities are lagging in returns, but the current conditions don’t necessarily mean long-term gloom. Emerging markets have their share of regional issues to grapple with, and a strong U.S. dollar has impacted global economies – yet despite this myriad of challenges, there is still hope on the horizon as strength can arise from adversity if we look towards new opportunities that exist amidst these difficult times.</p><p>Are you planning to Expanding Your Business Internationally or emerging markets companies?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Here are five compelling reasons that you should consider Expanding Your Business Internationally;</h2><p>According to Kavan Choksi, investing in international and emerging market companies may sometimes seem daunting, but ignoring these opportunities could mean missing out on some of the most robust portfolios.</p><p>While it’s true that global economies can be volatile at times, compelling reasons exist to broaden your investments outside U.S. borders for truly great returns.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Invest in Companies, Not Economies</h3><p>Investing across borders can open up a plethora of possibilities for investors. By focusing on individual companies with fundamentals that stand out, regardless of their economic environment, you will be well-positioned to identify strategic opportunities and maximize your returns.</p><p>As the economy shifts from global macroeconomic conditions to individual business performance, investors must stay abreast of news and information related to particular companies. Investing in such specific stocks can be complex, requiring sophisticated research skills and greater attention paid by industry professionals and savvy shareholders.</p><p>According to Gerald Du Manoir from American Funds International Vantage Fund SM, multinational companies often have little exposure to their home countries’ economic conditions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5.-Invest-in-Companies-Not-Economies-1024x683.jpg><p>Despite troubles afoot in Europe and other emerging markets, he remains confident that many potential investments are still waiting for discovery within these locations. Examples include Airbus’ presence in the United States and China, LVMH’s foothold on luxury goods throughout America, and TSMC, one of the world’s most prominent semiconductor manufacturers based outside Taiwan – illustrating how seeking opportunity beyond borders can bring success regardless of local circumstances.</p><p>Kavan Choksi mentions that in the face of economic uncertainty and a competitive business landscape, global companies are finding success amidst diversified market strategies.</p><p>Airbus is on track to deliver 700 commercial aircraft this year–a testament to their adaptability in today’s world economy.

Don’t Let the Strong Dollar Hold You Back</h3><p>Staying ahead of the economic curve is key, and even a powerhouse currency like the U.S. dollar won’t last forever – now’s an ideal time to prioritize positioning yourself for success in this ever-changing economic landscape.</p><p>The U.S. Dollar has enjoyed significant strength in recent years due to the American economy’s overall stability, higher interest rates, and its status as a safe-haven currency choice for investors seeking protection from market volatility overseas.</p><p>This trend was accelerated this year when the Federal Reserve raised rates significantly to curb inflationary pressures. Unfortunately, these strong dollar winds have made investing abroad more challenging by lessening returns upon conversion into dollars.</p><p>Kavan Choksi mentions that with the U.S. dollar currently overvalued by an estimated 20%, Capital Group currencies analyst Jens Søndergaard has suggested that these conditions won’t last long. While no signs are pointing toward a peak in its value, all attention is now turning to what the Federal Reserve will take action.</p><p>Despite conventional wisdom, a strong U.S. dollar does not always have negative implications for companies outside the United States. Indeed, some organizations may benefit from this currency effect. Take Sanofi – the French drugmaker reported that an impressive 1 billion euros boosted its sales in the first half of 2022 due to exchange rate fluctuations alone.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Tap Into International Global Dividend Opportunities</h3><p>Investing in international stocks can be attractive for investors looking for dividend opportunities.</p><p>Kavan Choksi says any overseas markets offer yields far greater than their counterparts within the U.S., so investors should look abroad when considering where best to capitalize on juicy dividends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tap-Into-International-Global-Dividend-Opportunities-1024x683.jpg><p>While some investors may have once viewed dividend-paying companies as dull and unappealing investments, today’s choppy markets reveal a different story. Now more than ever, “boring is beautiful,” according to Caroline Randall of Capital Income Builder® – referring not only to the U.S. but also international and emerging markets where dividends are an <a href=#>integral part of investment opportunities</a>.</p><p>Recent data showed that by October 31st, 2022, 600 non-U.S.-based stocks were yielding between 3% and 6%, whereas there were just 121 in America offering comparable returns then.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Leverage the Power of Old Industries to Fuel New Economy Growth</h3><p>Kavan Choksi notes that the coronavirus pandemic has caused a major disruption in the stock market, causing investors to adapt to the ever-changing environment. With e-commerce and social media companies struggling, attention is now being shifted toward more traditional businesses, such as those within the materials, financials, and industrial sectors, many outside America’s borders.</p><p>Meanwhile, tech giants like Apple Inc., Amazon, and Microsoft continue providing innovative solutions from inside U.S. territory, driving growth in the healthcare sector worldwide during times of uncertainty.</p><p>The past decade has seen a stellar performance for U.S. tech stocks, driving the gap between U.S. equity returns and their non-U.S counterparts in an unprecedented manner.
