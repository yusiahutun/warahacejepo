This is a precedent set by Babel which has worked out pretty well for JavaScript. So indeed, postcss-nesting is the one in postcss-preset-env, and that makes good sense.</p><p>One bit of trouble there is that native CSS nesting is fairly turbulent. It’s just been stable enough for <a href=#>Safari and Chrome to ship it</a> in preview browsers, which is not really proof that’s how it will stay.</p><p>I think I like how it shipped. It’s easy to learn and teach, as Jen says:</p><p>In summary, CSS Nesting will work just like Sass, but with one new rule: you must make sure the nested selector always starts with a symbol.</p><p>Along the way, there were all sorts of things considered and tested. Using <code>@nest</code> was a big one. Double <code>{{ }}</code> was considered. Required <code>&</code> was considered. I don’t even know what all was just talked about, what made it into versions of the spec, etc. <a href=#>Looks like</a> postcss-nesting has only been around a few years, but it’s on version 10 already, so it’s undergone plenty of change.</p><p>So you could update your packages, and suddenly your CSS won’t compile anymore (or less intense: you start to get compilation warnings) because the way you’ve authored it is no longer what this plugin supports anymore because the spec has changed.</p><p>Is that what you want?</p><p>There is not a right answer.</p><p>That sounds awful to me. I hate that kind of hamster-wheel work of updating code that is no better than how I left it, and maybe worse because I’ve hand-poked it and could have inadvertently screwed it up. But… maybe it’s for the last time. Maybe now the spec is done. Maybe the processor won’t change again because it is mimicking native CSS. Maybe the next time you touch it is removing the processor because you don’t need it anymore. That removal part does sound kind of nice.</p><p>The other path, the postcss-nested path, is not beholden to the spec. It’s a nesting spec all to its own which is not intended to ever be removed (like Sass). You don’t wake up to a version change that breaks it because the demands on it aren’t the same, there is no shifting sand under its feet. That sounds nice too. You’re stuck with the tool but it’s stable.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWlpbGdgaHxxfo6nnKysmaO0brXNZqeoq6SYwLR51qGgnKBdrK66edOoZKCnXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stan-verrett-looks-back-childhood-10-years-espn-segment-net-worth-flaunt-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stan Verrett Looks Back To Childhood 10 Years After ESPN Segment; Has Net Worth To Flaunt?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hunter-schafer-starry-night-painting-marni-dress.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hunter Schafer Looks Like a Walking &amp;quot;Starry Night&amp;quot; in This Marni Dress</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
