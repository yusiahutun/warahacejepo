The 51-year-old mum of two is, she says, "fitter and healthier than ever" and, thankfully, is happy to share her health and beauty hints and tips.

How do you stay motivated to eat well and keep moving?</strong></p><p id=eZ7hfgpxnbvw data-wc=59>"Over the years my focus has changed – now I look after my body not so it looks good, but so I am healthy, strong, energised and happy. That's more important to me than the number on the scales. Plus, I have my children to keep up with. Life is busy and I don't want to miss a second."</p><p id=ei3TjqnrD-V7 data-wc=9><strong>What are your tips for keeping energy levels high?</strong></p><p id=e8K0EfAQPB1I data-wc=65>"My Super Elixir [the company co-founded by Elle] Alkalising Greens mixed with coconut water or water; every morning; at least seven hours' sleep; water – at least three litres a day; Super Elixir Nourishing Protein, especially if I am on the go and missing a source of 'clean' protein in my breakfast or lunch; and taking some quiet time, morning and evening, to be mindful."</p><p id=eJwd_VlWqvo8 data-wc=22><strong>You favour an alkaline diet and we have talked before about your energising smoothies, so you have to tell me your recipe…</strong></p><p id=e6dPXVdOu0wg data-wc=18>"Blueberries, banana, chia seeds, almond milk, two teaspoons of my green powder and one large scoop of protein."</p><p id=ep5JMksC_S0Z data-wc=7><strong>Describe a typical day's eating for you…</strong></p><p id=ev7mTHdDhHIN data-wc=70>"I try to follow a 'clean' diet – lots of leafy greens, salad, fruit and vegetables and clean, hormone-free protein like fish and chicken. I like my protein powder mixed with almond milk – it's a great nutritious snack or a healthy meal replacement. It contains all nine essential amino acids, nutrients to balance blood sugar levels, fibre to keep you feeling full and B vitamins to help combat stress."</p><p id=eW4LyZqkUUfH data-wc=4><strong>Do you take supplements?</strong></p><p id=ejSjtDrh9bNF data-wc=106>"I don't take tons of vitamins and supplements now that I have Super Elixir as it's complete and from organic and whole foods. The greens help me maintain good nutrition and keep my body balanced. Many people believe that an alkaline and pH-balanced body combats disease, encourages cellular renewal and is therefore anti-ageing. I've found that when all of the 11 body systems are nourished well and detoxifying properly, they are in their optimal state. I feel that when my body is balanced, my energy is good, workouts are stronger. I've lost weight around my middle, I have less sugar cravings and I feel more energised."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4db7491da214-elle2-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ebXC9SjHVvbU data-wc=8><strong>Elle revealed the details behind her alkaline diet</strong></p><p id=elniv8xu9vvW data-wc=6><strong>Do you have any health concerns?</strong></p><p id=eMdrJKLbgEOt data-wc=62>"I had a health scare a few years ago and it made me more aware of the value of good health. It was also the catalyst to discovering the concept of an all-purpose supplement. With the help of Dr Simon Laubscher we created a product just for me – as a response to my health scare – and Super Elixir was born."</p><p id=elBZZVT0BoVX data-wc=9><strong>One piece of health advice to your younger self?</strong></p><p id=ePGqlyAcIcS3 data-wc=2>"Wear sunscreen!"</p><p id=eCzBtuVbSaps data-wc=19><strong>You spend a lot of time flying – how do you stay healthy and well, both in- and post-flight?</strong></p><p id=eRZc26RcuWzL data-wc=44>"With my green powder for overall nutrition and to keep my body in a healthy alkaline range. And water – hydration's so important when flying, for skin and energy. I also use Dr Sebagh rose oil, which is great for dehydrated skin while flying."</p><p id=eK_9_hOZ7RKd data-wc=9><strong>What are your favourite ways to stay in shape?</strong></p><p id=eZtY1LQvOWeT data-wc=98>"I make exercise part of my everyday life. I have a much simpler and gentler routine now. I prefer not to go to the gym; instead, I make sure I find at least 45 minutes in my day, usually for a sport outdoors, which is easy in Miami. I love to paddle board, surf, swim or waterski. My advice is to find 45 minutes to move – even something simple; walk the dog; leave the car and walk to work. I'm more likely to stay with it if it's something I love and that fits into my life."</p><p id=e1_X2RHbrUdc data-wc=4><strong>Any favourite workout wear?</strong></p><p id=ed6_RDlFe6RB data-wc=30>"Adidas by Stella McCartney. Fit, colours, fabric – winning combination. I love her ethical stance with manufacturing and materials and she also makes great trainers. Nike is a staple, too."</p><p id=euPUOyVR355pq data-wc=8><strong>And swimwear- given you now live in Miami?</strong></p><p id=eJVqmmLU7essy data-wc=14>"I love Melissa Odabash's bikinis.

You can also use exfoliating gloves, great for improving circulation."</p><p id=eG_R9jCufafdR data-wc=12><strong>You favour classically beautiful, flattering make-up. What's always in your make-up bag?</strong></p><p id=eH2C2jsN-PhOg data-wc=97>"I keep it simple when I'm not working – just sunglasses and lipgloss most days. For dressing up I've done pretty much the same thing for years – a smoky eye and neutral lip; hair down. I'd love to do a red lip and eyeliner but it's just not me. You learn what suits you. My go-to products are my Bobbi Brown lipgloss, Kevyn Aucoin mascara – no more panda eyes – and Perricone foundation. For nails my favourite is Essie After School Boy Blazer and I like white on my toes – it just seems chic.</p><p id=eQZsC1TRgB7CX data-wc=4><strong>Any favourite hair products?</strong></p><p id=eWv5E-j0WN2pV data-wc=3>"I love Oribe."</p><p id=eFgWHFllO-xoW data-wc=4><strong>What's your signature scent?</strong></p><p id=eo5yxYHMPm9y5 data-wc=9>"Guerlain's Vetiver – I've worn it for 30 years."</p><p id=e5IcAx4tCT7d4 data-wc=4><strong>When are you happiest?</strong></p><p id=e0jVtiooVmQgT data-wc=23>"With my family – brothers, sisters, parents, children, step-children and my husband.
