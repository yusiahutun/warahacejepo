Hiring a trained makeup artist probably seems expensive, so if you think spending a ton of money on one night of the year is silly, don't worry you won't settle for doing your own and messing it up: There are affordable ways to get your makeup done, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These are the best at-home and in-store services that'll make getting ready for Halloween this year completely stress-free.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-nearest-mac-makeup-counter></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>YOUR NEAREST MAC MAKEUP COUNTER</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's a MAC location at seemingly every mall in America, so chances are you can book a Halloween makeup appointment near you. For $90, the artists at MAC will give you the look of your wildest Halloween dreams in 90 minutes or less. The price includes a 20-percent discount on products, a free mascara, and a face chart that can help you do any touch ups at home. However, there is a caveat: Not all MAC stores offer the service, but the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>brand's website</a> breaks down all of the locations that do Halloween looks.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-glamsquad></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>GLAMSQUAD</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you live in New York City, Southern California, the Bay Area, Southern Florida, Washington D.C., or Boston, you're probably familiar with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Glamsquad</a> â€” the on-demand service that lets you book hair and makeup artists to get "glammed up" in your very own home. Well, guess what? They do Halloween makeup, too. The seasonal service is priced at $125 or $200 depending on the complexity of your look. However, if you need fake blood or jewels to complete your vision, you'll have to provide them yourself.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-make-up-for-ever-stores></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>MAKE UP FOR EVER STORES</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Considering MAKE UP FOR EVER started off as a go-to stage makeup brand for performers, hitting up one of the brand's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>standalone boutiques or boutiques within Sephora </a>before heading out for Halloween is guaranteed to get you on the best costume list this year. Yes, the service is pricey ($100 for full-face FX application and $175 for face and body FX application), but you'll get a look that you wouldn't come close to be able to doing on yourself. (We imagine painting your body from head-to-toe yourself wouldn't be easy.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-blushington></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>BLUSHINGTON</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For anyone in New York, Dallas, or Los Angeles, you can make an appointment at one of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Blushington</a>'s locations, or book one of the beauty lounge's makeup artists to come to you.
