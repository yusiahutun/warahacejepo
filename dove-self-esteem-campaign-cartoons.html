However, given that I like to think there is no female or male ‘ideal’ anymore, the pressure on young people to be the perfect versions of themselves (often in photographs) is relentless.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My son is only two years old and barely capable of uttering the word ‘Snapchat’ (not that I’m trying to teach him that one), but my first hurdle in this confidence context is whether to reinforce the notion to him that he’s ‘beautiful’ (which, obviously, I think he is). Instinctively, it seems the positive, esteem-building thing to say and do – and I hear parents at the kiddy clubs doing it all the time. Yet placing value on aesthetics can be damaging in itself. My toddler is regularly told by well-meaning friends and strangers alike what beautiful curls he has and how he’s lucky to have such a gorgeous ‘tan’ (he’s mixed race…) at an age when he should rightly be blissfully unaware of his appearance. Should he have more striking features–flame red hair, or prominent freckles, for example–I imagine he’d be starting to reference them by now, which would certainly concern me.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Something that fills my heart with hope is the Dove Self-Esteem Project"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Something that fills my heart with hope, though, is the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dove.com/uk/dove-self-esteem-project.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dove Self-Esteem Project" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dove Self-Esteem Project</a>, the biggest provider of self-esteem education of its kind, which since 2004 has positively impacted over 29 million young lives across 140 countries worldwide.
