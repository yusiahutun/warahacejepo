According to The New York Times<a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">,</span></a> Shari spent years working at National Amusements, the theatre company that is also a holding company for Paramount. As her father’s health waned, she made several efforts to gain control of the company. The tough businesswoman, who is also a trained lawyer, won and promoted the idea of a merger between CBS and Viacom, now called Paramount.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/07/4cf23082-1bb4-4839-8892-f560b93e7cf9_f84d204e.jpg>Once labelled a “featherweight who had <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">won her job by nepotism</span></a>”, as per LA Mag, Redstone quickly turned the naysayers into fans when she made impressive business moves after she took over her father’s empire. She was also named one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People of 2020, which solidified her position. She currently serves as the non-executive chairwoman of Paramount Global and president of National Amusements.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What do we know about Shari Redstone’s personal life?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/07/ea76ca9d-b351-4b52-9c7c-5208f1a9acc3_1bdf904f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Redstone’s unexpected rise in the media and entertainment business sparked intrigue in the woman herself. She is an orthodox Jew and adheres strictly to the kashrut law and the sabbath. Kashrut laws govern dietary observances that Jewish people must adhere to. Per LA Mag, it is common for Redstone to arrive at meetings with her own food and utensils. She is also rarely spotted out at Hollywood restaurants.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Where is Chelsea Clinton now, amid revelations about her 2010 wedding?</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/07/031af4ef-acff-4642-a29d-302b1dc70b0f_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her relatively low profile is vastly different to that of her father, who was described as charismatic and outgoing by many in the industry.

Not only did she have to fight for control of the family empire against senior business associates, her father tried to buy out her share of the family business multiple times. Per Variety, Sumner managed to convince his son Brent to sell up, but Shari refused to budge, even though he offered US$1 billion. In fact, the family feuds were so well documented, they were rumoured to have inspired the hit show Succession – although <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the Murdoch family is often mentioned</span></a>, too.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite their public beef though, when Sumner died in 2020, Shari wrote a moving tribute to her father: “My father led an extraordinary life that not only shaped entertainment as we know it today, but created an incredible family legacy. Through it all, we shared a great love for one another, and he was a wonderful father, grandfather and great-grandfather. I am so proud to be his daughter and I will miss him always.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">The richest cast members of Beverly Hills, 90210 – net worths, ranked</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Who was Shari Redstone’s husband?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/07/c4d7bcb0-7c5e-47aa-afc4-37a3fba722c7_c396a5cf.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shari was married to Yitzhak Aharon (Ira) Korff, a Boston-based Orthodox rabbi who is the father of her three children.

Speaking at an event in 2022 celebrating the establishment of the Sumner M. Redstone Endowed Chair in Health Equity, she said, “When I think about my family’s experience, I know how lucky we have been. The reality, however, is that for far too many people, access to high-quality, comprehensive care remains out of reach. And that is a detriment to society as a whole. That is why Mass General’s efforts to eliminate health inequities are so exceptional.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Arianna Huffington’s profile of Shari for Time, she wrote, “Shari is a true trailblazer, and whatever she does next, it will be a sequel well worth watching.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZp6mpJq%2Fta3Ip6SepqRkrrPAyJyjnmdjZ4JyfpByZqadlal6tLTAq6BmqpWZwLW7zZ5kpqGcobawusCiqZ5lla2ypHnBnp%2BippRivaK%2BwKamrqakYsK0ecyem6KZXaK8qMHLZp2am5Woeq7By62gm6GcobawuoydpqWkkad6pbHBrQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-queen-tears-in-public-royal-yacht-britannia-decommissioned-the-crown.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Queen's TEARS for royal yacht - the rare moments she showed emotion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./matthew-rhys-admits-getting-little-protective-keri-russell-nude-scenes-americans-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Matthew Rhys admits being 'protective' of Keri Russell during nude scenes on The Americans</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
