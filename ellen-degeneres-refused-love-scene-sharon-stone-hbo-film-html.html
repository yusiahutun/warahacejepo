The film followed three LGBT couples in three different time periods, featuring an ensemble cast that included Sharon Stone, Ellen DeGeneres and others. As the name suggests, it was a sequel to 1996’s If These Walls Could Talk which starred Demi Moore.</p><p id=par-4_44>Stone was brought on to the project by one of the film’s directors and screenwriters, <a href=#>the late Anne Heche</a>. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Larry King</a>, Stone shared that all it took was a simple phone call from Heche to recruit her for the movie.</p><p id=par-5_42>“Well, when Anne called me and said she had written something she wanted to direct, I thought, ‘I bet that’s good because she’s a smart, talented, funny, interesting, compelling, truthful person.’ So I said, “I really want to read that,” Stone said.</p><p id=par-6_14>Stone also considered <a href=#>the former TV host</a> as a huge draw to the project.</p><p id=par-7_54>“And when I read it and it was a romantic comedy that was very well done, and I knew that I could co-star opposite someone who was really facile with comedy and that I would be able to learn from Ellen, I thought this is terrific. So I decided to do it,” she added.</p><h2 id=h-ellen-degeneres-was-against-doing-love-scenes-with-sharon-stone>Ellen DeGeneres was against doing love scenes with Sharon Stone</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_49>Doing love scenes was new territory for DeGeneres. Although Stone may have been accustomed to doing scenes of this nature, DeGeneres hadn’t been seen in a similar way before. It was a far cry away from the characters she’d portrayed on television, most notably in her hit sitcom Ellen.</p><p id=par-9_59>”It’s a different side of me,” DeGeneres once told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>. ”My TV character was always a self-deprecating, very nervous, very goofy kind of person, a grown-up but kind of like a child. I was like Peter Pan for a while. I’m a little more grown-up in this. There’s a sexuality about me that people haven’t seen.”</p><p id=par-10_20>This created some hesitance on her part when it came time to film love scenes with <a href=#>the Basic Instinct star</a>.</p><p id=par-11_38>“I fought Anne for months, saying I wouldn’t do the love scene. She was like, ‘It’s Sharon Stone.’ I said: ‘I won’t do the scene. I’m not getting naked. I’m not going to kiss somebody else,'” DeGeneres insisted.</p><p id=par-12_19>It was a concept that Heche, who DeGeneres was dating at the time, had trouble wrapping her head around.</p><p id=par-13_19>”What other lesbian on the planet would say, ‘I won’t do a love scene with Sharon Stone’?” Heche quipped.</p><p id=par-14_16>But DeGeneres reminded there was much to think about when opening herself up to the camera.</p><p id=par-15_29>“To me, it’s a very private thing that I don’t think you show the world, and yet it was important to show that part of the relationship,” DeGeneres said.</p><h2 id=h-sharon-stone-felt-more-compatible-with-ellen-degeneres-during-their-love-scene-than-with-most-male-co-stars>Sharon Stone felt more compatible with Ellen DeGeneres during their love scene than with most male co-stars</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-16_46>Eventually, DeGeneres gave in and did the scene with Stone. Unlike DeGeneres, however, <a href=#>the Casino actor</a> had no qualms with pretending to make love to her co-star. In fact, Stone asserted she had a more comfortable time with DeGeneres than she had with most male actors.</p><p id=par-17_37>“I have to say that I’m not gay. But I was more compatible in my love scene with Ellen than I have been in some other love scenes….. that I’ve had to do with men,” she said.</p><p id=par-18_27>She asserted this was because Stone and DeGeneres were familiar with each other. With some of her other male co-stars, Stone just didn’t share that same connection.</p><p id=par-19_27>“Because some people you don’t have as much of a comfort. We have a comfort, a friendship that made it easier for us to be,” Stone explained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSyrbjEp2SdnZeau6a%2BxKxkq52WqsCmsIylpq%2BdXaiwprrEZqqhmaKku26%2F06ilnmWYl7xussilpGegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ellen-sirot.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ellen Sirot - Vulture</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./boston-calling-called-off-due-to-covid-19.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Boston Calling Called Off Due To COVID-19</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
