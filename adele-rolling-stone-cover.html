"And that takes a very big man, because I'm very successful at what I do. My last boyfriend was uncomfortable with how successful I was, and the fact that he had to share me with lots of people."</p><p>Despite all of those relationship rumors, the Grammy-winner says that she and Konecki are not married or broken up. "I have said a million times I'm not married and everyone still says we are," she explains. "But, yeah, we're still together. We haven't broken up. We've never broken up. We've been together. We just haven't felt the need to get married. We've got a kid together. I feel like that's a big enough commitment."</p><p>Speaking of their kid, the 27-year-old star admits that it was her 3-year-old son, <strong>Angelo</strong>, who inspired her return to music.</p><p>"I don't know if I would've come back had I not had my kid. I'm very proud of what I achieved. And I wasn't, before I had Angelo," she admits. "I didn't understand, actually, what I had achieved and how far I had come. Because everyone wants to do something with their life, and we don't all get the opportunity because s--t gets in the way. So I feel f--king so fortunate that the stars just aligned for me and allowed me to have the most ridiculous ride ever."</p><p>Adele adds that her son is the only one who is able to boss her around because he "completely rules" her.</p><p>"All the things I really like about myself, he brings out in me, and he's the only person that tells me no," she says. "He completely rules me. He's the boss of me, and it's so funny for other people to watch, because I'm the boss of everything in my work life."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/dc/o/2015/11/03/dc78076b4f8851819dc553ed9e42a0e4_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Twitter</span><p>Even though her first single, <strong>"Hello,"</strong> continues to top the charts, Adele admits, "My career's not my life. It's my hobby."</p><p>"People think I hate being famous. And I don't. I'm really frightened of it," she says. "I think it's really toxic, and I think it's really easy to be dragged into it."</p><p>One thing that keeps her on track is her solid group of friends. "As 21 got bigger and bigger, I started getting back with all my old friends. I needed them big time."</p><p>So, does she have a squad? "I've heard about a squad," she quips. "I wish my squad was all supermodels. We are, in our brains. I guess I have my own squad. It's not as interesting as some of the other squads that are around right now. But maybe <strong>Rihanna</strong> can be in my squad! That would be really cool. Oh, God. She's life itself, isn't she? I love her."</p><p>The singer also opens up about her image and how she's often pitted against -- as Rolling Stone put it -- the "Mileys of the World."</p><p>"I'd rather not be the person that everyone gets pitted against," she says. "If they do decide to get their body out, I would rather not be that person because that's just pitting a woman against another woman, and I don't hold any more moral high ground than anyone else. So that has pissed me off a bit. Not that I'm going to start getting my tits out now!"</p><p>"I've been asked, 'Would you do Playboy?' so many f--king times, it's ridiculous," she continues. "Is that because I'm a woman or because I'm fat?"</p><p>"Would I show my body off if I was thinner? Probably not, because my body is mine," she adds. "But sometimes I'm curious to know if I would have been as successful if I wasn't plus-size. I think I remind everyone of themselves. Not saying everyone is my size, but it's relatable because I'm not perfect, and I think a lot of people are portrayed as perfect, unreachable and untouchable."</p><p>She admits she has been working out a bit more than usual lately, "to get in shape for myself, but not to be a size zero or anything like that" -- but admits she's "not, like, skipping to the f--king gym. I don't enjoy it."</p><p>"And if I don't tour, you'll catch me back down at the Chinese!"</p><p>LOVE her!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnZ7kGpmaWtflrGmuMRmqaiknJ67qHnSraannV2YvLex0Wg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ms-launches-clementine-snow-globe-22950697.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>M&amp;amp;S launches Clementine Snow Globe gin in a mini bauble perfect for Christmas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-deafeated-brave-rape-victim-brutally-stabbed-home-invader-speaks-out-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Willowbrook rape victim Melissa Schuster who was brutally stabbed speaks out</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
