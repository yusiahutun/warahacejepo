Almost everybody has seen movies with casino scenes though from Casino Royale to Ocean’s 11—and still, these movies might be a bit misleading.</p><p>What you are supposed to wear depends on many things including the venue, the time of the day and if it is a private party, you are attending or just a general visit. In this article, we are going to help you pick your outfit for a visit of casino in Portugal. A Portuguese iGaming expert Victoria Oliveira helped us with ideas. Read more about Victoria <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Do your research</h3><p>When you plan to visit a Casino in Portugal, the first thing you should do is read up on its dress code. Most casinos display this information on their website, but if you can’t find anything on what to wear you can check out Tripadvisor posts or Google reviews. Calling up or messaging the casino in advance is also a good idea as you’ll not want to be under or overdressed.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Casino in Portugal</h3><p>In general, we can say that most casino in Portugal expect you to be smart casual (and we will detail this below). Formal outfits are rarely required and in general, you shouldn’t be too casual either. That being said, Portugal is a sun holiday destination for many so you will see holidaymakers visiting casinos along the beach in shorts and T-shirts. You should definitely not try to enter in flip-flops, shirtless, or in swimwear though as you will most likely be refused entry.</p><p>If you can’t be bothered to dress up at all, you can always play casino games. To find a reliable <a href=# rel=noopener>online casino</a> it’s always better to check reviews before playing for real money. Play from the balcony of your hotel room, from the pool bar or anywhere you fancy. Easy!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Common Casino Dress Code Terms</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. <strong>Smart-casual</strong></h3><p>We can say that 99% of the time you can’t go wrong with smart-casual at Casino in Portugal. Smart-casual is something you would wear in a nice restaurant, a trendy bar or even a business meeting. It can be smart jeans that are not worn out or torn, a blouse for women, a shirt for men and a blazer or jacket. Ladies should wear high-heels and men can don leather shoes or loafers. For gents, a tie would be optional.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>2. Dress to impress</strong></h3><p>You’ll often come across this term on casinos’ websites. This means that they want you to make an effort when visiting the establishment. Casino outfit ideas for ladies are smart cocktail dresses with tasteful accessories. Check out Demi Moore’s outfit in <a href=# rel=noopener>Indecent Proposal</a> for inspiration. You’ll not have to run to the mall to buy an expensive new dress though. Even a short black dress will do if you match it nicely with high-heels, jewellery and a nice handbag. Gents should definitely wear a dark suit with black leather shoes and a tie.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Black tie and white tie</h3><p>It is rare for a Casino in Portugal to require white-tie and even black-tie outfits but it is not unheard of. If you are invited to a private event at a casino, these most formal dress codes will be required, but don’t worry, the organizers will surely let you know in the invitation card.</p><p>A casino party dress, in this case, would mean a floor-length dress for women made with quality fabrics such as velvet, silk or satin. You can don plenty of accessories, including gloves and a tiara for the most formal parties.</p><p>Black-tie for gents means a white dress shirt, black bow tie, a waistcoat, a black dinner jacket and black leather shoes – just like James Bond in <a href=# rel=noopener>Casino Royale</a>! White tie outfits consist of a white bow tie, a white waistcoat, a black jacket with matching trousers, black leather shoes, a stiff-front white shirt and accessories such as cufflinks and shirt studs.</p><p>When you visit a <a href=#>casino games</a> in Portugal, you should be fine wearing smart-casual clothing. However, try to find out the dress code in advance to avoid embarrassment. Formal outfits are rarely required in Portuguese casinos and casual clothing is often tolerated in beach-side establishments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZIBuwMipqmaen6d6r7XGoatmp6Wpeqq6jJyYrKGepHqquoyppquspZyurQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brantley-gilbert-song-about-son-barrett.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brantley Gilbert Wrote a Song About His Son That'll Make You Cry</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sam-gehry.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Sam Gehry dating?
