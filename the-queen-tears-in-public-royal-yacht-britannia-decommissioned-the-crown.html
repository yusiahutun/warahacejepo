The devastating event resulted in the death of 144 people, 116 of whom were children. One day after the final victim was recovered from the debris, the Queen and <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Philip</a> travelled to pay their respects to the deceased and their loved ones.</p><p id=eDUUWUmymZGR data-wc=94>It was later reported that waiting eight days to visit was one of the monarch's biggest regrets, but she appeared visibly moved as she walked around the site of the tragedy with her husband. "I think she felt in hindsight that she might have gone there a little earlier. It was a sort of lesson for us that you need to show sympathy and to be there on the spot, which I think people craved from her," said Sir William Heseltine, who worked in the royal press office at the time of the tragedy.</p><p id=ednoDLiD91ZS data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess of Wales to honour the late Queen with touching service - details</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/75df3e842fb7-queen-aberfan-z.jpg><p id=eS4EV10yTeNY data-wc=11><strong>The Queen and Prince Philip pictured on their visit to Aberfan</strong></p><p id=eZo1sJtf-OuC data-wc=57>The Queen's visit to Aberfan was put under the spotlight once again in season three of The Crown. Many criticised the portrayal of the monarch, who is told in one scene to "display emotion". Actress <a class=hm-link href=#>Olivia Colman</a>, who stars as the monarch, later voiced the line: "I dabbed a bone-dry eye and by some miracle no one noticed."</p><p id=e0_yWlbFqMRr data-wc=47>However, viewers were less than impressed by the "cold-hearted" portrayal of the Queen, with one tweeting: "Shame on the #TheCrown's producers! It's ridiculous how they portrayed the Queen as unfeeling during the Aberfan disaster. There's a video on YouTube of her visit and she is clearly upset."</p><p id=eKk5ZyF1WjUW data-wc=37>Harold Wilson's then-press secretary Joe Haines also commented on the narrative that the Queen was faking her tears at Aberfan: "Anyone who saw her at The Cenotaph knows that," he said, calling the show's narrative "absolute nonsense".</p><p id=eZM8S2SpOSSb data-wc=1><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>King Charles differs from the Queen in this specific way</a></p><p id=eYHK6kJzJSRP data-wc=5><strong>WATCH: The next royal generation</strong></p><h2>The Decommissioning of Royal Yacht Britannia – 1997</h2><p id=eM_xFgL1_22b data-wc=44>The Queen famously shed a tear when she attended the decommissioning of the Royal Yacht Britannia during a ceremony in Portsmouth in 1997. Overcome with emotion, she was seen wiping her eyes as her beloved yacht was taken out of service after 22 years.</p><p id=e_KUPkg-Rz3S data-wc=76>The Queen had a deep personal affection for the vessel, which she had herself launched in April 1953.

The Queen was seen discreetly wiping it away with her gloved hand before managing to regain her composure. For a few moments afterwards, she closed her eyes. During the ceremony, she had laid a wreath with a simple message: "In memory of the glorious dead.
