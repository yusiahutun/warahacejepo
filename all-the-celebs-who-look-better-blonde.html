The Australian actress is known for her signature blonde tresses in addition to being Hollywood’s favorite bombshell. I mean, think about her major-motion-picture moments like playing Noami in The Wolf of Wall Street or Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad—the people love to see her blonde!

As someone with naturally dark hair, she revealed on a recent episode of Live with Kelly and Ryan that it takes up to eight hours to bleach her roots. Kim also shared that she’s “going to stay blonde for a minute,” which is totally fine with us! The Skims founder has been rocking platinum blonde hair ever since her Met Gala 2022 look. Since then, she’s even bleached her eyebrows to match in a shoot with Interview Magazine and continues to embrace the Marilyn Monroe vibes at Milan Fashion Week, where she curated the Dolce & Gabbana SS23 Show.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">3</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Pete Davidson</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dimitrios Kambouris</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not-so-subtle transition to Kim’s most recent ex, Pete Davidson. After leaving SNL, the comedian dyed his hair to match his former girlfriend earlier this year. Some couples have matching shirts or shoes, but matching hair styles? Talk about romance! Although this relationship didn’t last too long, we sure hope Pete’s blonde does. It’s undeniable that this heartthrob has a unique laid-back style, frequently showing out in sweats at red carpet appearances, so of course he can pull off the cool-boy blonde.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">4</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">JLo</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">James Devaney</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not only are we thrilled for newlyweds, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, but it’s crucial we include this honey-blonde bride in our round-up. The singer, dancer, and actress is known for her light brown hair and blonde highlights; usually styled in a classic bun or full-glam blowout. We’re sending our best wishes to the happy couple and cannot wait to see what’s in store—hairstyles and all—for JLo.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">5</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Ryan Gosling</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dave J Hogan</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ryan Gosling, who’s the face of Gucci’s new luggage campaign, is one of Hollywood’s beloved blonde actors. While the La La Land star is naturally dirty-blonde, Gosling had the internet buzzing when they saw photos of him sporting platinum-blonde hair while filming Barbie this summer. Whether dark- or platinum-blonde, here’s to the real-life Ken!</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">6</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Pharrell Williams</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Samir Hussein</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">From becoming a legendary music producer to building an entrepreneurial empire, it seems like Pharrell Williams knows how to break through the industry barriers. The trendsetter and fashion mogul has had his fair share of fashion statements; we’re still thinking about his 25-karat Tiffany & Co. gem-rimmed sunglasses he wore during Paris Fashion Week this year. He’s been changing the game for decades. We could go on, but Pharrell’s blonde buzz is just the cherry on top of all of his top-tier style choices.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">7</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Billie Eilish</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Max Mumby/Indigo</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Being an all-time hair chameleon while also conquering the music industry? Get you a girl that can do both. Billie Eilish started off her career with edgy, eccentric hair colors, such as cobalt blue or jet black with green highlights. However, shifting to a blonde bob made for her most notable look as she released her second studio album Happier Than Ever. Although Billie’s gone back to black, it was refreshing to see the singer as a blonde in 2021.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">8</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Beyoncé</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Larry Busacca/PW</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, we had to include Beyoncé, who’s expected to announce her “Renaissance Tour” for 2023 in the coming weeks. Queen B has been loyal to her honey-blonde hair for the majority of her career, frequently alternating between warm and cool tones. But let’s be honest, no matter what the Queen’s hair choices may be, she’ll always have her Beyhive (AKA dedicated army of fans) rooting for her.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">9</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Scarlett Johansson</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Matt Winkelmeyer</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like her diverse range of roles throughout the years, Scarlett Johansson has had her fair share of hair styles: glamorous blonde curls, a chic strawberry-blonde, a short side-swept cut, and even a mullet. ScarJo has truly done it all. The Black Widow star is naturally brunette but has recently been seen with a short blonde cut. Lately, Johansson has been busy launching The Outset, a skin-care brand she founded with CEO Kate Foster Lengyel.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">10</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Rachel McAdams</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Steve Granitz</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Whether she’s playing a hopeless romantic in The Notebook or the popular it-girl in Mean Girls, Rachel McAdam continues to prove to us that she was born to be a blonde. McAdams has been blonde, strawberry-blonde, brunette, and even a redhead; she’s not afraid of a hair switch-up. After accomplishing Marvel’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness this year, with flaming red hair, we are eagerly waiting to see the actress’s next steps.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">11</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Doja Cat</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Frazer Harrison</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Doja Cat, who recently shaved her head and eyebrows off on Instagram Live, never ceases to amaze us with her versatile looks. The Grammy-winning artist is a frequent wig wearer and one can always count on her for a unique look at an appearance. One that stuck with us was her blonde ’90s-styled hair at the 2022 Grammys. We’re here for the classy, supernova-girl vibes.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">12</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Evan Mock</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Theo Wargo</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Are frosted tips back? Regardless, we are living for Evan Mock’s buzzed blonde hair. The skateboarder, model, and actor is famously known for his pink hair in the Gossip Girl reboot, but he has been recently spotted with an icy new ’do. It’s giving ’90s, and we’re not complaining.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">13</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Sophie Turner</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mike Coppola</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even the Queen of the North looked better with blonde hair. Sophie Turner, a natural redhead, has been an on-and-off blondie ever since her GoT days. As of late, the actress made an appearance (for a whopping 5 minutes) in Netflix’s Do Revenge. Her character, Erica Norman, stole the show with her fiery red hair.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">14</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Emma Chamberlain</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeff Kravitz</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Whether she’s front row at fashion week, vlogging on YouTube, or running Chamberlain Coffee, we are digging Emma Chamberlain as a blonde. This isn’t the first time as a blonde for the internet personality, but Chamberlain dropped jaws as she debuted her return to the light side at the 2022 Met Gala.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">15</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">BLACKPINK’s Rosé</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Arturo Holmes</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you’re one of the millions of BLACKPINK fans, then you are no stranger to Rosé’s icy-blonde locks. The K-pop star has been testing (and pulling off) an array of colors including lavender, blue, and silver throughout the years. To many, she’s recognized as the blonde member of the fashion-forward group. Rosé recently attended the Yves Saint Laurent (which she’s also the face of) show during Paris Fashion Week as a stunning strawberry-blonde.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">16</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">J Balvin</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Boyko</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Making a statement with color is one thing, but J Balvin has also incorporated prints throughout his hair journey. Think about all sorts of patterns and designs—working as art—on his clean-shaven head. Aside from his bold choices, the Colombian singer has pulled off short blonde hair multiple times. In addition to his undeniable swag, the chart-topping artist has put a spotlight on mental health. Earlier this year, he launched OYE, a bilingual wellness app that aims to empower anyone struggling with mental health.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">17</span><h2 class="css-1kyrymh eutn2uj7">Saweetie</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeff Kravitz</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Saweetie, the “ICY GRL” rapper, has tapped into icy-blonde hair. She has experimented with numerous hair styles, but we’re still obsessed with the platinum-blonde cut she revealed in 2021.

Having always known the actress as a blonde (she is Elle Woods, of course), we were stunned to find out she’s NOT legally blonde.
