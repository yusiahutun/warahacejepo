Nanshan SEI Investment, wholly owned by Shenzhen Nanshan District State-Owned Assets Supervision & Administration Bureau, took up US$100 million or 79.3 per cent of the shares on offer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Laekna’s HK$791 million IPO last June, two state-linked firms, Yuyao Yangming Equity Investment Fund and Future Industry Investment Fund II, absorbed three quarters of the shares offered by the Chinese biotech company.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/26/e81b0359-b25a-4e45-8362-be386d76f8d1_3148f920.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“IPO activities have been slow worldwide, so if there is any investor support, whether anchor or cornerstone, market participants will go ahead [and capitalise on them],” said Nisa Leung, managing partner of Qiming Venture Partners, an early investor in Chinese tech leaders including Xiaomi, Meituan and Bilibili. “Their participation could decline when the market picks up and sentiment improves.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On average, cornerstone investors soaked up about 27.5 per cent of IPO shares in Hong Kong last year, the highest since at least 2014, according to Dealogic data. Their presence in that period coincided with a crushing four-year slump, prompting big guns like Temasek Holdings, asset managers, pension trusts and sovereign funds to retreat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong’s stock market has shrunk by 36 per cent to US$5 trillion over the past three years, hurt by social unrest, the Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, higher interest rates and China’s economic wobbles. The Hang Seng Index lost a cumulative 34 per cent between 2019 and 2023.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Commitment by cornerstone investors is seen as a seal of endorsement that can stir demand from retail investors, according to Raymond Ng, a partner at law firm Harneys. In market downturns, “any guaranteed subscription would help fill the book, thereby enhancing the chance of pushing an IPO over the finish line”, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The presence of local government entities as cornerstone investors in IPOs is being questioned amid market losses. Their role may have backfired as they failed to impress or inspire the broader market, according to Sumeet Singh, head of research for IPOs and placements at Aequitas Research in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Generally blue-chip financial investors coming in as cornerstone provides an assurance to other investors as well about the valuation and future prospects of the stock,” he said. “However, the local government-backed entities might have other considerations apart from just financial gains. Hence, their participation doesn’t really send a strong signal for the rest of the market.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eight in 10 IPOs since 2021 are currently trading below their offer prices, turning what used to be an easy windfall into a major investment pitfall. The 231 IPOs in Hong Kong since 2021 have inflicted a 43 per cent loss on investors on average, based on data compiled by the Post up to April 18.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">J&T Global, which attracted Temasek, Sequoia and Hillhouse Capital as cornerstones, has plunged 36 per cent since its debut. Invesco, Qatar Investment Authority, UBS Asset Management and Neil Shen’s SNP China Enterprises have also suffered as cornerstone investors in biotech firm Wuxi XDC, whose stock has declined 14 per cent.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Private credit funds lure family offices, wealthy individuals as returns sizzle</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Returns for Chinese local government entities have been equally rotten. Nanshan SEI has lost about US$11.6 million on its stake in Robosense since the stock debut. Local government-owned asset managers in Shanghai and Tianjin have lost 60 per cent of their IPO bets in Horizon Construction Development.</p>Some seasoned investors view the situation as unhealthy. Too much state-linked involvement is typically frowned upon by investors as it could distort supply and demand and weaken market discipline. China’s <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">recent market intervention</span></a>, by pumping billions into exchange-traded funds tracking local benchmark indices to lift stock prices, is one example.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/26/044ce68e-2e24-4823-ae3c-e4fdaaa235bc_34f54c2a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For a healthy, functioning capital market like Hong Kong, we need private sector professional investors and institutional investors buying and deciding the credit liquidity,” said Fred Hu, founder and CEO of Primavera Capital, a private equity group. “Government is not a natural investor. They are regulators. China’s future is the private sector.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hu is concerned about the over-reliance on cornerstone investors in IPOs, saying it sometimes fails to generate realistic pricing and distorts growth profile of the issuers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As market conditions have been volatile, and with Hong Kong stocks underperforming global markets, the cornerstone process is something that will give issuers a higher degree of certainty in the IPO success, said John Lee, vice-chairman and co-head of Asia in Hong Kong at UBS Group.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“With the market being more challenging, cornerstone investors are now more selective with the deals they want to invest in,” he added.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong bankers on ‘survival mode’ as IPO drought ends windfalls</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The role of local government entities as cornerstone investors will strengthen the ties between the companies and the local authorities where they operate, Lee said. The arrangements are in line with policies that encourage them to focus on strategically important sectors, such as healthcare and electric-vehicle manufacturing, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This sentiment is shared by UBTech, China’s biggest manufacturer of educational and humanoid robots. Its HK$1 billion IPO in December attracted E-Town International, an entity ultimately owned by the Financial Audit Bureau of Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, as a key investor with 53 per cent of the IPO shares.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When we choose strategic partners, we hope they have long-term investment patience and vision,” said Michael Tam, chief brand officer at UBTech. E-Town, which operates a hub for advanced manufacturing, can provide “great synergy,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s not for the lack of trying. UBTech had engaged with many global investors in the run-up to its IPO launch. Many engagements with potential cornerstone investors did not materialise, possibly because the market conditions at the time affected their willingness to invest, Tam said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">As China’s debt risks mount, the spectre of looming local crises rears its head</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">About a fifth of all the new offerings that introduced local government cornerstone investors during the past year were undersubscribed, according to Phillip Securities. Robosense only managed to sell 58 per cent of the portion allocated to local retail investors, according to its filing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The traditional big-name cornerstone investors like Temasek used to be a no-brainer; retail investors would just go ahead and participate,” said George Au, deputy sales director at Phillip Securities. Chinese local government-related entities just do not have the same force or pull factor, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese local government investment vehicles may suffer from poor publicity, with some facing dire refinancing pressure. They could be the weakest link, or the source of market fissures, if a third wave of defaults ensues under high financing costs and tighter regulations, according to S&P Global Ratings.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Brace for ‘third wave’ of China bond defaults on financing costs, tighter policies: S&P</span></p></a></h3>They have US$20 billion worth of debt coming due this year, the second-largest group after the US$34 billion that needs to be repaid by the nation’s struggling property developers, S&P said.

That lack of confidence was on display this week when bubble-tea chain group Sichuan Baicha Baidao Industrial Co – the city’s biggest IPO of the year thus far – failed spectacularly on its trading debut.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese bubble-tea maker’s IPO hopes pop in biggest letdown in 6 years</span></p></a></h3>Support may be on its way.

Stronger measures taken by Beijing to recharge the mainland economy, and possible interest-rate cuts in the US later this year, are supporting factors, it added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It may still boil down to the fundamentals, Primavera Capital’s Hu said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We need to make sure the quality of the company, the governance, the business model, the financial profile and the pricing are all attractive as a package,” he said. “You do not need cornerstone [investors].
