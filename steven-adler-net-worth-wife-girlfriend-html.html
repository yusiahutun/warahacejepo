He's known for being the former drummer of Guns N' Roses, and his contribution to the rock music industry is certainly&nbsp;notable. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>His super successful career as a musician has enabled him to amass a substantial net worth. He has his&nbsp;well-received work in the music industry since the 80s to thank for it.</p><h2>Steven Adler's Staggering Net Worth&nbsp;</h2><p>On January 22, 1965, Steven was born in Cleveland, Ohio, as&nbsp;Michael Coletti, named after his father. But he changed his name to Steven, taking his stepfather's last name&nbsp;after his parents separated.</p><p>Steven found his passion for music early on in his teen years. He learned to play the drums when he was in high school, and soon, he saw a future for himself among the bass, snare, and sticks of a drum set. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Read about other famous rock musicians:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Sneak Peek on Peter Criss's Married Life & Rough Relationship History</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Before joining the legendary rock band Guns N' Roses in 1985, Adler was a member of&nbsp;Road Crew&nbsp;with his friend Slash&nbsp;and Hollywood Rose&nbsp;with his Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin.</p><p>But those bands were dissolved quickly. After departing from Guns N ' Roses, he also&nbsp;formed a few other bands, including 'Adler's Appetite' and 'Adler.' <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Steven now has a whopping net worth of $15 million, according to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a> from his various ventures in rock music.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, more factors lead to his massive net worth other than records and albums. For example, in 1990, Steven was fired from&nbsp;Guns N' Roses due to his lack of performance and drug abuse.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>But in 1991, Adler had a huge <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">altercation</a> with the band member and filed them for a lawsuit of $2.5 million. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He had accused the band of stealing his writing credits and held them responsible for his drug addiction, which gave birth to this huge controversy.</p><p>Eventually, after two years, the dispute ended after the band made an out-of-court settlement payment. Recalling the incident, Adler explained, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They were taking my royalties, all my writing credits. They didn't like me anymore and just wanted me gone. That's why I filed the lawsuit - to get all those things back.</p><p>The settlement added a bump to his overall net worth. Moreover, Mr. Adler is still active in the music industry. He is still performing and touring with his newly formed band, and the rockstar in him is well alive. So his net worth is sure to keep on growing in the future.</p><p>What's also going well for the 57-year-old musician apart from his career is his marital life with his dear wife. After a rocky history, Adler is a happily married man.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Meet Steven Adler's Wife</h2><p>Steven is married to his wife,&nbsp;Carolina Ferreira. They said their vows in 2002 and have been in unison to date.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Steven Adler With His Wife&nbsp;Carolina Ferreira (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</strong></p><p>Steven does not have any children, but he is a proud dog owner. He has four adorable dogs and considers them part of his family, alongside his wife.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>His fur babies make frequent appearances on his social media account. Moreover, he is an avid animal lover, and he likes to help out other dogs in need by providing a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">foster</a> home&nbsp;for them.</p><p>Besides, his marriage with Carolina is not his first. He was previously married to his girlfriend Cheryl Swiderski from 1989 to 1990. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Unfortunately, their marriage fell apart, and his wife left her because he struggled with drug addiction.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, Steven has successfully overcome all the ghosts of his rough past. As a result, he is an icon for music lovers. With an impressive net worth and a beautiful partner by his side,&nbsp;Adler is now leading a joyous life.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunC8jqyrnq6Vo3qisMueqWamlal6uLvRrZ9mr5mbsm6zyKujn6qZmrulesetpKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-rise-and-fall-of-burger-kings-halloween.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Rise and Fall of Burger King's Halloween Whopper</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./assumption-julian-broderson-among-the-big-winners-in-des-moines.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Assumption Julian Broderson among the big winners in Des Moines.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-quay-collection.html>Chrissy Teigen On Her New Quay Sunglasses Collection and Avoiding Internet Burnout</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-universities-rise-newly-published-global-subject-rankings-driven-positive-employer.html>Hong Kong universities rise in newly published global subject rankings, driven by positive employer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./flower-trends-2024.html>The Flower Trend Predictions For 2024, According To Bloom &amp;amp; Wild</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./troy-osterberg.html>Who is Troy Osterberg dating?
