Taylor-Johnson said.</p><p>The couple's relationship is hardly a fluke either, with their time together surpassing her marriage with ex-husband, 60-year-old art dealer, Jay Jopling.

"If I had questioned anything, it would never have worked. I'm quite instinctual. I've gone feet first into everything in my life. I'm always, 'This seems amazing', and I jump straight in and go through the experience, whether good or bad."</p><p>She added, "It's definitely a 'F--k it, let's go with it' approach. And I'm a great believer that the heart overrides everything. Love conquers all."</p><p>The pair compliment each other too, with Sam, who shares two children with the Kraven the Hunter actor noting, "He gives me that sort of stability, calmness."</p><p>"I'm definitely the kind of frenetic, mad energy that needs someone to anchor me. Keep me a bit more grounded. Which he certainly does," she continued. "He really loves being quiet, in nature.
