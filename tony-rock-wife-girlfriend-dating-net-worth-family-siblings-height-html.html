It might not be true in every case, but Tony Rock is a perfect example of the above statement. He is the younger brother of the comedian Chris Rock and just as amazing as him when it comes to making the people laugh. It could be an understatement to say that he has not been in many projects as compared to his brother, but he too had his own sketch comedy TV series The Tony Rock Project. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-172 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Career and Net Worth:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The first time he appeared on the TV, his job was that of the host of a short lived game show, Can You Tell. He also worked as a correspondent for Battlebots on Comedy Central for its fifth season. After appearing on various radio and television shows that include The Howard Stern Show and The D’Angelo Show, he performed to highlight Apollo Theater.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He then acted in the sitcom All of Us before joining his brother as a backup. He had a recurring role in Everybody Hates Chris and hosted The Funny Post on TV One. He has appeared in Think Like a Man and has been hosting Apollo Live on BET. He has amassed a whopping net worth of $4 million that affords him a lavish life as well.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Is Tony Even Dating?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>After all, he is a comedian, and a person could rarely resist laughing when he opens his mouth. Also looking at his age, there could be guesses that he is a married man with a wife. But that seems to be a too far sighted thought as his tweets are so much suggestive of the fact that he could be single at the time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>There are not the lack of female followers and admirers who love his work and looks as well. So, what is the thing that’s preventing him the luxury of dating and having a girlfriend? The post on his Instagram might have the best answer to that.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><p style=text-align:justify>As he explains in it, a person who is working hard to improve himself and earn money doesn’t get time to entertain the females; it’s not hard to imagine that he is currently chasing his dreams and has decided to stay away from relationships for the time being.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Short Bio:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Tony Rock now aged 43 was born on 30th&nbsp;June 1974 in New York, United States. He was born to the parents Rosalie and Julius Rock. He has nine siblings, seven brothers, and two sisters in the family. Chris Rock is one of them. The American National belongs to African American ethnicity.
