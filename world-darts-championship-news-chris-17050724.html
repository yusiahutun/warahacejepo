I was actually at the bingo with my mum when Nick, a friend of mine, came in.</p><p>“They were short of a player for the local darts league and he asked me if I would mind standing in.</p><a class=gallery-interaction href=# data-link-tracking=inArticle|slideshow><span>Peter Wright hair: Darts star's craziest styles</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19433961.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_713502> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15327206.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_1171364> <span class=label>View gallery</span></a><p>“I had never, ever played but it turned out it was one of those natural things.</p><p>“I stepped in, carried on playing and might have lost once during the season. I played in a local club called The Ridge Farm. I was 21 and could not believe it.</p><p>“I progressed more than a lot of my friends and they kept saying ‘push yourself’, you need to go on to better things and I gave Q school a crack.”</p><p>And qualify he did, winning his PDC tour card, quitting his job and he now sits in the top 40 in the Order of Merit having earned almost £104,000 in the past two years.</p><p>“It has been a massive pay rise compared to what I was on at work but you have to just focus on the game,” said Dobey, who will bank £11,000 for his first round appearance having progressed to the second round on his debut here last year.</p><p>“It is about the money but you still want the results at the end of the day.</p><p>“The money in darts is getting more and more but the standard is getting harder and harder to win that money. It is a lot of money. I have done well to get that far.”</p><p>An evening shift at the Ally Pally is a total contrast to his previous job as Dobey, whose partner Evyn gave birth to their son Cole five months ago, explained: “I did work away for a lot of the time, in Scotland and stuff.</p><p>“We would do 12-hour shifts, say 6pm to 6am which you would do for a couple of weeks and then you would change to nights.</p><p>“It was messing with my darts too much. I just had to give in in the end to focus on my darts career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I used to do all different things in my job: I would work in the yard, make signs, put the signs out, sit on the closure point when roads are closed.</p><p>“People would give you grief but it was our job, we cannot do anything else.</p><p>“One of my friends got cans of pop, apple, or pot noddles thrown at him. It is a tough job and completely different to what I am doing now”</p><p>And it will be an occasion to remember for the man called...Hollywood.</p><p>“My nickname started off as a little joke,” said Dobey. “I used to come in wearing what I want for darts – shorts, a peak baseball cap, whatever I felt comfortable in.</p><p>“Someone shouted ‘Who do you think you are, some kind of Hollywood star?’. The name stuck.”</p><p>As will the name Chris Dobey if he switches off The Power.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Oaqa2rX6y8s7jDZpuaqqSoeqS0wKanoqeeqLWqvIynnLCrXZi1s7XSZmhwaGVlhHOA</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-white-t-shirts-for-women.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Best White T-Shirts for Women 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./royal-family-university-degrees-revealed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Regal graduates!
