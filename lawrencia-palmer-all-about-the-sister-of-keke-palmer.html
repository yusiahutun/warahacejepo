She also discussed what it’s like to be a famous sibling.&nbsp;People tried to take advantage of her as Keke’s sibling, according to her.&nbsp;It was also a learning experience for her to distinguish between false and genuine, she explained.</p><h2>Loreal, her oldest sibling, won the first season of Claim to Fame.</h2><p>Keke is not only a relative, but she also has two other siblings: Loreal, her oldest sister, and Lawrence, her identical brother.&nbsp;Her oldest sibling Loreal earned the $100,000 reward money on the first season of Claim to Fame after fighting against the two champions Pepper L.C. and Logan Crosby, who was recognized as Dean Martin’s grandchild and Jason Aldean’s nephew, respectively.</p><p>She disclosed that she was Keke Palmer’s elder sibling after winning the program. She went on to add that they are each other’s greatest supporters.&nbsp;She also disclosed that Keke is the moniker she gave herself.&nbsp;When she found out her parents were expecting, she proposed the name Keke, but her mother informed her that was not the actual name.&nbsp;So they gave her the middle name Keyana so they could refer to her as Keke. That’s where she received her moniker. Lauren is Keke’s given name. Loreal stated in an interview that she hopes to use the reward money to establish her own production business and make independent horror films as a creative writing student.</p><h2>Her sister drove her and her identical sibling to a cabaret joint.</h2><p>Her sibling Keke appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live to discuss her latest film Alice admitted to bringing Lawrencia and Lawerence to a Vegas burlesque bar.&nbsp;She stated that she thought bringing her brothers would be enjoyable. Lawrence, her sibling, was with his partner.&nbsp;But then her brother and his partner began giving matching charts to the dancer, which she thought was odd.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Lawrencia-Palmer-1.jpg alt="Lawrencia Palmer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She claims to have a nice rapport with the strippers and performers.&nbsp;She was always having a wonderful time before and after Hustlers (Keke portrayed a dancer in Hustlers).&nbsp;She added that it becomes a type of female gathering where they neglect to dance. In the same interview, she stated that her father and mother both have twins and that having twins is not prevalent in her family, despite the fact that it is genetic. Her parents had her older sister and then her and chose for the twins to be twins where she was like why couldn’t she have been the twin which she dislikes them for, she joked.</p><h2>Net worth</h2><p>Her total value is presently being calculated. As of now, we know her famous sister’s net worth, who has a successful job.&nbsp;She is worth a staggering $7.5 million.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijmq%2BimruktcBmp5qknZq%2Fbq3LpWSamp%2BqwW7Ax55krKGjqbKzec6fZKSdm5p6sa3LppyrZ1xheW14i2U%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./531354-natalia-dyers-ethnicity-nationality-parents-background.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Natalia Dyer's ethnicity, nationality, parents, and background</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-mago.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Steve Mago dating?
