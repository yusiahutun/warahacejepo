Tour opening acts?</h2><p>Olivia Rodrigo’s Guts World Tour opening acts include The Breeders, Chapell Roan, PinikPantheress, and Remi Wolf. In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Billboard</a> in September 2023, PinkPantheress explained how Rodrigo asked her to be an opening act for the Guts World Tour. “Obviously Olivia is way bigger than me, so at first, I was quite nervous to say yes,” she said. “But then I was like, ‘I feel like I need to do this.’ And then she texted me to say, ‘Thank you so much for saying yes! I can’t wait!’ and that has gotten me so excited.”</p><p>PinkPantheress explained that she first met Rodrigo over a dinner in London in 2021 and have been friends ever since. “We’re both quite similar ages and so it was quite nice to meet someone in front of me who was my age and had the same type of interests and sense of humor,” PinkPantheress said. “We’ve had different experiences in the <a href=# id=auto-tag_music-2 data-tag=music-2>music</a> industry, but she can still empathize with a lot of what I might be going through as a young person navigating the industry and everything.”</p><p>She continued, “I recognize her as somebody that takes a break. There are some people in the industry that like to be constantly surrounded by the limelight, but I feel like she’s one person that takes her time, and will take time out and really take a step back when she needs to, which is similar to me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-olivia-rodrigo-s-guts-world-tour-set-list>What is Olivia Rodrigo’s Guts World Tour set list?</h2><p>Olivia Rodrigo’s Guts World Tour set list is expected to mostly include songs from her second studio album, Guts, which was released in September 2023 and includes singles like “Vampire,” “Bad Idea Right?” and “Get Him Back!” See Olivia Rodrigo’s full Guts track list below.</p><li>“All-American Bitch”</li><li>“Bad Idea Right?”</li><li>“Vampire”</li><li>“Lacy”</li><li>“Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl”</li><li>“Making the Bed”</li><li>“Logical”</li><li>“Get Him Back!”</li><li>“Love Is Embarrassing”</li><li>“The Grudge”</li><li>“Pretty Isn’t Pretty”</li><li>“Teenage Dream”</li><li>“Obsessed (Hidden Track)</li><li>“Scared of My Guitar” (Hidden Track)</li><li>“Stranger” (Hidden Track)</li><li>“Girl I’ve Always Been” (Hidden Track)</li><p>In an interview with Apple Music in July 2023, Rodrigo explained how she came up with the title Guts after her first album, Sour. “I’ve had it for a long time. I had it actually when I was making Sour. I’m like, ‘I want the next one to be Guts‘. I like had it in my head, four letters, all caps, just like Sour, I love it,” she said.</p><p>She continued, “I just think it’s an interesting word. People use it in so many interesting contexts, like ‘Spill your guts’. ‘Hate your guts’. It means bravery, but it also means intuition, like listen to your gut. I just think it’s all of these things that coincidentally were things that I’ve really been thinking about in this chapter.”</p><p>As for what makes Guts different than Sour, Rodrigo told Apple Music, “To me this new album Guts, and this new song ‘Vampire’, kind of feels like a natural progression, a natural step forward in my life and sound and music.”</p><p>Rodrigo also told Apple Music in September 2023 about how her caeer and artistry has changed since the release ofSour in 2021. “I think the first time around I was just filled with so much adrenaline, I was like, ‘OK, wow, this is happening. I’ve never done this before,’” she said of Guts. “This time it feels a little more real and it’s a scary thing to know that people are going to be curious and they’ll maybe have a lot of ears on it.”</p><p>She continued, “I think that, in general, making this album has given me a lot of confidence as a songwriter. I think writing the first album, it just felt so spontaneous. I was 17 years old learning how to write songs for the first time and just pouring my heart out. I had so much to say. I think this time I was in a different place and I was having a lot of pressure and a lot of expectations placed on me and I think I really had to try to block out the noise and just focus on the craft of songwriting. I wasn’t going through my first 17 year old heartbreak and I think that it forced me to be maybe a little bit more creative in the way that I write.”</p><p>As for the theme of Guts, Rodrigo told Apple Music, “I feel like when you’re making the album, you can’t really see the forest through the trees a little bit about what’s about or what you’re trying to get across. Sometimes you just wake up and go into the studio and see what comes out of you. In hindsight, I think that a lot of this album is about the confusion that comes with becoming a young adult and figuring out your place in this world and figuring out who you want to be and who you want to hang out with and all of that stuff. I think that that’s probably an experience that everyone has had in their life before, is just that rising from that disillusionment.”</p><p>Rodrigo also revealed that she recorded 25 songs for Guts and confirmed that “some of them will definitely see the light of day” even though she didn’t include them on the album. She also told Apple Music that “Teenage Dream” was the first song she wrote that made it onto Guts. “The last line is a line that I really love and it ends the album on a question mark,” she explained of “Teenage Dream.” “The line is, ‘They all say that it gets better. It gets better the more you grow. They all say that it gets better. What if I don’t?’ I like that it is like an ending, but it’s also a question mark and it’s leaving it up in the air what this next chapter is going to be. It’s still sort of confused, but it feels like a final note to that confusion, a final question.”</p><p><span class=s1>Olivia Rodrigo tickets to the Guts World Tour are available on <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>StubHub</span></a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Vivid Seats</span></a>.
